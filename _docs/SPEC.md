# During: Product Spec (v0.23)

> A one-line diary that assembles itself. While you write it, your presence shows on the surface for a few close friends.
>
> **The hand throws moments at stories; the machine shelves them in time.** (H20)
>
> **Blog structure, without blog cost.** A post is a title and some blocks, extended over days; a one-line post is a complete post; the month shelves it. (H21)

Domain: during.today. UI language: English. First users: 1:1 friends (most general case), then couples and church small groups via Pools.

The reward loop: **being witnessed is the hook, the personal archive is the retention.** Records are written for oneself; sharing is a side effect (a leak, not a broadcast).

Revision notes: v0.2 dissolved the former "Non-negotiables" section (product prohibitions became MVP hypotheses; system rules moved into their operating sections). v0.3 applies H6 (v1 restructured into v1a/v1b) and H7 (palette mid tone corrected to #787BE2). v0.4 applies H8 (#787BE2 scoped to chip foregrounds and the wave ramp; law 5 split into content surfaces vs interactive chrome). v0.5 applies H9 (wave tone deleted; law 4 narrowed to ropes and empty slots; the commit ring becomes a multi-ring ripple). v0.6 settled H9's open item (an in-progress timed travels; grow deleted). v0.7 applies H10 (timeline exclusivity and inner ripples). v0.8 corrects section 5.4: the axis is ordered, not time-proportional (H16). v0.9 applies H12 (the ghost lands on a compressed axis inside the sheet). v0.10: inner ripples are created from the parent Ripple's detail sheet, not the input sheet. v0.11 applies H13 (the landing rail is progressive; time is a segmented toggle). v0.12 applies H14 (law 1's sinking is scoped to sections within a scroll; a paged day keeps its ground). v0.13 applies H11 (scope re-cut into solo-first phases; v1a/v1b/v1.5 retired). v0.14 applies H15 (a running record gets a now band and a focus screen; solid #0507C9 means a live session; wave colour is contrast-determined). v0.15 adds Break to H15: a timed inner ripple; the parent session keeps gross duration and no net time is shown. v0.16: the focus screen carries the deep wave preset and hosts the sheet as an overlay; inner composition is Drop-only. v0.17 reverses calm-water rendering; a break inherits its parent's category rather than having one of its own. v0.18 applies H17 (the Ripple detail sheet; edit is the input sheet; hard delete takes its media and its inner ripples). v0.19 refines H17: a finished record's end is correctable, and the Daily Note prompt opens the sheet with no time. v0.20 applies H18 (kind is end-presence at the input surface too: a typed span makes a timed Ripple, and the present is written by the Timer). v0.21 applies H19 (the Lanes matrix and the Locker Trail ship; law 1's sinking finds its first consumer in their month sections; the empty-state voice is fixed). v0.22 applies H20, the Splash pivot: the record unit is a story fragment; identity is record/retrospect and live tracking goes dormant; Splash is promoted from P3; the exclusion constraint is dropped; ink fill means selection and blue fill means action; six default lanes. **v0.23 applies H21, the refounding**: During becomes a compact blog-form diary on the water ground. Ripples compose Splashes (a block inside a post); Sessions are shelves — monthly ones derived, custom ones made; Home is the blue ground scoped to one month; a post is read and written on its own white page; a declaration (date, lane) is a default, never an override; deleting a post deletes its blocks; the two-mode home, the quiet marks, the mode toggle, the sheet pair and the tab bar's `+ with wave` retire.

## 1. Design hypotheses (ship the MVP without these, then confirm or revise)

Rationale for the demotion: a document's authority should come from rationale, not labels, and the asymmetry favors testing. Adding these later is cheap; removing them once shipped is nearly impossible. Shipping without them IS the experiment.

| Hypothesis (MVP ships without) | Decide-by signal |
| --- | --- |
| No likes, comments, rankings, streaks, follower counts | Reactions migrating to KakaoTalk = intended division of labor. Recording volume decaying = witnessing alone under-rewards. |
| Witness signal is a view count only, never a viewer list | How often "who saw this?" gets asked directly. |
| No chat: no threads, no reply chains; Splash logs flat, quoting one level max | Whether one-level quoting is reported as cramped, and whether conversation stays comfortably in KakaoTalk. |
| No feed: Home is one month of **my own** posts on the water, oldest at the top and today at the bottom; nothing anyone else wrote ever arrives on it (H19, H21) | Whether the ground gets read as a feed once friends exist in P2. |
| No guilt devices: no streaks, no red gaps; unchecked plans fade quietly, empty days pass silently, empty states read as invitations | Whether recording persists without reinforcement. Habit requests are served by suggestion-row re-drops first. |

## 2. Vocabulary (fixed, do not rename)

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Ripple** | A **content block inside a post** (H21a): a paragraph, a photo, a line — a story fragment with a voice (H20a), shelved in time by the system. Two kinds remain: **drop** (a point, no duration claim) and **timed** (a block *with a span*, the only kind that shows duration); kind is end-presence, not provenance (H18). Most blocks carry **no time annotation** and rest at their post's declared date, else where they were written; an `occurred` annotation is an instruction to place the block where it happened and always wins (H20c, H21f). A ripple with no splash renders as an untitled post of one block. *Dormant (H20b):* the Timer, the running record, and **inner ripples** (`parent_ripple_id`) — the modules stay for P3's Swim; no surface offers them. |
| **Splash** | A **post** (H21a): a title (optional), some blocks, a display range and lane tags. Ripples compose it: a block belongs to exactly one post, and deleting the post deletes its blocks. A post may **declare** a date range and a lane; both are *defaults* for its blocks, never overrides (H21f), and its lane tags are derived — the declared lane first, then every lane its blocks took. A post may be **pinned** (H21g) and may belong to at most one custom Session. Solo in P1; shared by two in P2; pool-wide in P3. |
| **Session** | A **horizontal shelf of posts** (H21e), one stint in the water. **Monthly sessions** are derived from the calendar — every month is one, a row exists only once it is titled — and a post appears in every month its display range touches. **Custom sessions** are made: a title, an optional declared range, an optional lane; a post sits on at most one. The old tracking sense (a running timed record) is retired. |
| **Swim** | A live quiet co-presence session. Per-person lanes numbered by join order; the last lane is always an empty "your lane" slot acting as the invitation. |
| **Pool** | A **group space**. Explicit membership. Home of shared artifacts. Unbuilt in P1 (a reserved seat). |
| **Lobby** | The pool browser screen (my pools, join with code). |
| **Lanes** | The **topic axis through all time** (H21a). Top level: my categories. Inside a pool: that pool's categories. A lane is a division of the water; the category is what the division means. On Home the lanes head the ground and filter it, and the last slot of that row makes a new lane: this is the lanes view. The matrix (the former Lanes tab) is dormant until P3's pool Lanes. |
| **Swimmers** | A pool's people view. Daily zoom: time-aligned score view. Weekly zoom: person-column matrix. |
| **Locker** | My private global archive and recall engine. Outside any pool. Sees everything, including locked drops. |
| **Submerge** | Presence expiry. Per-user TTL (default 3 days; options instant / 1d / 3d / 7d). Expired members disappear from rosters entirely (no "submerged" badge). Past Ripples persist; only "presence" expires. |
| **Link** | Mutual friendship. The only kind; no asymmetric follow. |
| **List** | My private labels over Links, used for audience routing. Never visible to others. |

Retired vocabulary (do not reuse): Stream, Deck, Pan, Table, Event, Moment, Log, and **Session in the tracking sense** (H21a). **Thread** is banned as a UI noun: it collides with the no-chat hypothesis (section 1). "Post" and "block" are descriptive prose for a Splash and a Ripple, never identifiers. The ground has no name of its own — it is just **Home** (H20d).

## 3. Social graph

- **Link is always mutual.** No follower asymmetry, so no audience accumulation.
- **Pool membership is independent from Link.** Groupmates need not be friends. Never join these tables to imply friendship.
- Two visibility paths for a Ripple:
  1. **Link path:** my rail appears in my friends' Home (subject to List routing).
  2. **Pool path:** only what is mapped/leaked into that pool, visible to all members including non-friends.
- A non-friend pool member's profile is a dead end: only their in-pool Ripples + a Link request button. Never a gateway to their full timeline.
- Lists are the answer to "send to friend-group A and B at once". Routing asymmetry (I show you more than you show me) is acceptable and undetectable by design (no view lists, no membership visibility).

## 4. Leak model (routing) and category rules

- Records are made in Home ("a dot on my Trail"); pools receive them by **leak**, not by publish.
- **Explicit mapping is the precondition of any leak.** my_category to pool_lane. No name-match auto flow (identical names in different pools are different contexts).
- Pool join screen is a **privacy contract**: "these things will flow into this pool." Suggested mappings for matching names come pre-checked, **except residual categories (e.g. Day), which default unchecked.** When a residual category is about to be mapped, nudge toward creating a dedicated category instead.
- Zero mappings = lurker membership. Fully valid, no warning copy, CTA adapts ("enter without connecting").
- Per-drop override: a small audience chip on the input sheet. One spectrum: everyone, selected lists/pools, only me (lock). Lock is not a separate toggle. **Absent in P1** (H20g): no audience exists solo, so fragments default to Everyone and the lock toggles in the detail sheet; the chip re-enters the sheet at P2.
- **Lane membership is per-space and derived** (H20h): a Ripple keeps one personal category; pool-side lane assignment lives on the sharing record (the P3 join table carries `pool_lane_id`), never as an array on the fragment. Detach ends the pool-side membership.
- My category names are mine; pool lane names are the group's. Mapping connects them without forcing shared vocabulary.
- Locker always contains everything. TTL governs presence only.

**Category axis rules (system rules, embodied in the schema):**
- Categories answer only "what". "With whom" = participants. "When" = the page and time fields. "To whom" is not a category (a future marker at most).
- One event may produce several Ripples; category assignment is per Ripple, never per event.
- Structured-data ambitions (scores, distances) go into note conventions, never into schema fields.

## 5. Information architecture

**Top level (slots full; any future feature demanding a tab is auto-rejected):**

```
Home / Locker + FAB
```

Pools and Friends are reserved seats, unbuilt in P1: no tab, no dead button. Session management is a sheet on Home, not a tab; the Lanes tab retired at the refounding review (Home's lane header is the lanes view).

- **Home: the water ground** (H21c, H21d). Layout authority: `_docs/mockups/home-ground.png`. One solid `#0507C9` surface, scoped to **one month** — the current month on open, another by the scrubber or from the sessions sheet (`/?m=YYYY-MM`). On blue ground the colour channels invert: white carries content and action, ink stays selection.
  1. **Lane header row** across the top: each lane as a ghost emoji, its name, and small white waves whose count is that lane's post count this month on the log scale (none when nothing). Tap = **filter** the grid to that lane (filter, not columns); tap again clears; the selected lane carries the ink selection treatment. The row's last two slots are the seat of a lane that does not exist yet, which opens the lane sheet, and a pencil, which opens the **lanes sheet** — every lane in a row, icon and name edited in place, the order changed by dragging each row's grip, a Delete per row behind a small confirm (refused with a count while the lane holds records, H19), one Save (this row is the lanes view). Faint white ropes hang from the headers through the empty water above the grid, per the mockup.
  2. **Post grid**: white pills — the position date small (the period, when the block it sits at spans days), the representative lane's emoji with the title, and a **wave mark** at the right (white waves on a blue disc) scaled by block count — each pill as wide as its title and no wider, wrapping left to right like tags in strict coalesced-key order, **oldest at the top, newest at the bottom**; the view opens scrolled to the bottom. An untitled post shows its first block's first words as a ghost title; a lone block standing in as a post is the inverse pill — blue with a white/50 outer border, its mark a white disc with blue waves and no border. A post's position in a month is its latest block in that month (H21e). Tap = the post's page.
  3. **Month scrubber** beneath the grid: every month under its year, in white; the scoped month at full strength and every other at 0.3 — opacity is the only difference, never size — each with its post count small when it has any. Tap = **scope**, never scroll-jump (H21h). The current month is the default scope on open. At the scrubber's left, an `=` opens the **sessions sheet**.
  4. **Pinned bar** (H21g) above the tab bar, in ink: pinned posts as compact chips with horizontal overflow; a chip opens the post. Absent when nothing is pinned. Persists across scrubbing.
  5. **Empty month**: *A fresh page of water.* in white, with the FAB as the only call.
  6. **Entry**: the FAB (bottom right) opens the post sheet (section 6). Nothing else on the ground creates.
- **A post's page** (`/splash/[id]`; "the splash detail", H21c): a **white full-screen page sliding over the ground**, not a sheet. A back chip top-left in blue text names where it came from (the month, or the session). Header stack, left-aligned: the lane tags (declared first, outline chips), the title at display scale, the date range small below (declared, else derived), and a wave underline under the title sized to the block count. Blocks below in time order, **oldest first**, one column at content width (on a wide screen the header keeps the left half and the blocks read down the right): a small muted date label, the body at reading size (15–16px, line height 1.6–1.7), photos at full content width with rounded corners, generous space between blocks and at most a hairline between them; no avatars, no cards. **In-place editing, blog-editor style, no sheet here**: tapping a block puts the cursor in it (Cancel / Save per block, Delete, the lock toggle — Everyone / Only me — beside them); an add slot at the bottom (*Drop your words here*) starts a new block directly on the page, defaulting to the declared date and lane (H21f) with `+ Add Time` to annotate otherwise and `+ Add Image` inline. The title and the declared date and lane are edited in place from the header; **pin / unpin**, the **session** assignment and **Delete** live in a quiet header menu. Delete deletes the post **and its blocks**: the confirm says *deletes the post and its N blocks* (H21, the reversal). A ripple with no post opens as an untitled post of one block and gets a row of its own the first time it needs one.
- **The sessions sheet** (H21e; review): session management lives in a white bottom sheet opened from the scrubber's `=`, not in a tab. A year pager at the top (chevrons and the year). One row per month of that year, January first, up to the current month: the month name small, the title large if titled (the bare month name, muted, if not), the post count small at the right; the current month's row reads in blue. Tapping a month navigates to Home scoped to it — no separate screen (H21h); titling a month from its row's edit affordance creates its lazy row, and clearing the title removes it. **Custom sessions** in a second section below: each row its title, its range (declared, else derived from its posts) and its post count; create = a title, an optional range, an optional lane. Opening one shows the **shelf**: the lane-first grouping — groups as columns where width allows, stacked sections on a phone, each headed by a ghost emoji and the lane name; a session with one lane, or none, renders flat; posts oldest first, as the home pill. Assigning happens from the shelf (an add-existing-post picker, recent first) and from the post's header menu; a post sits on at most one custom session, which the copy enforces by **replacement** (*moves from …*), never by refusal.
- **Lanes matrix** *(dormant since the refounding review: the tab retired because Home's lane header is the lanes view; the module stays for P3's pool Lanes)*: my categories x days matrix (wave cells). Includes locked blocks, unmarked (this view is mine alone). Column header = that category's dashboard: edit name/icon and delete while empty, plus where it flows — mappings — which arrives with pools in P2.
  - **A cell is a count, drawn as an impression** (H19): how many blocks that category held that day, log-scaled and capped, never a number. A day is the block's **coalesced day** — its annotation's date, else its post's declared date, else the author-local date it was written (H20c, H21f). **Future-dated blocks are not counted**: the day has not happened. Sections are months, sinking per law 1 as the scroll goes back.
  - **Quiet stretches fold**: three or more consecutive days with nothing recorded collapse into one low row (`Sep 2 to 6`). The threshold is tunable. The matrix is otherwise unbounded — today back to the first record — because the fold is what makes that affordable.
  - Interactions, two: a cell opens that day's month on Home, a column header opens that lane's sheet. Deleting a lane that still holds records is refused rather than resolved.
- **Pools**: room list with activity signals (ripple badges on pool cards: active Splash bar miniature, Swim traces). Lobby = browse my pools + join with code. No public search / open pools in v1. *Reserved; P3.*
- **Locker**: recall engine: the **Trail** (shipped), weekly recap (score view), aggregates ("42 tracks, indie pop lately"), one year ago today, export. Recall lives here; do not add matrices here or aggregates to Lanes.
  - **Trail**: my whole archive as one continuous backward scroll, newest day first, days cut on the **coalesced day** (H20c, H21f), each day's blocks still reading early to late. Locked blocks included, unmarked. A row opens its post's page at that block; a day header opens that day's month on Home. Sections are months and sink per law 1. **This is archive browsing of my own records** — the no-feed hypothesis concerns others' content arriving unasked, and nothing ever arrives at the top of one's own past (H19).

**Inside a pool:**

```
Swimmers / Lanes / Splash
```

- **Swimmers**: the room's daily screen. Daily zoom: time-aligned score view (per-person vertical lanes, me first, then join order). Weekly zoom: person-column matrix. Quiet members within TTL show as calm columns; past-TTL members have no column.
- **Lanes**: this pool's categories x days matrix.
- **Splash**: boards + **all joint Ripples (participants >= 2)**. The "records of us together" filter; ended Swims are absorbed here as joint-Ripple bundles. For couples this tab is effectively the shared album.
- **Swim has no tab.** Start: FAB sheet (secondary entry) or long-press on a lane. Live: a large intruding card wherever relevant (carousel peek if multiple). Past: a record card on that day's page + traces in Swimmers (simultaneous bundles).

## 6. The post sheet, and writing on the page

**One sheet, for new posts only** (H21). Every later word is written on the post's page (section 5). No mockup this round: the geometry below is the authority, built in `home-ground.png`'s visual language.

**The post sheet** — from the FAB on a phone. **On a wide screen the composer is not a sheet** (review): the same form stands in the right half as a rounded white card, always there with *Drop your splash* waiting — floating on the water on Home, on the page elsewhere, and absent on a post's page, whose right half holds the blocks — and the FAB is hidden. Beneath the card, in a card of its own, **the Locker's Trail**: a wide screen has no Locker tab, and the archive reads under the writing; a row's post page points back to its day's month on the ground. My own records, never a feed: nothing anyone else wrote arrives there (A1, H19).
- A bottom sheet on the dimmed blue ground, white, content-column width on desktop (the shared max-width token). **Two fields, one rule** (review): the title field, large, bold and blue (#0507C9), placeholder *Drop your splash*; beneath it the body field, smaller and lighter, placeholder *Enter the content*. Enter in the title moves on to the body, so the first line is still the title and everything after it is the first block's body. The sheet grows with its content to near-fullscreen, capped at the safe area.
- Below the text: the **lane chip row** — the declared lane; horizontally scrolling; a search field past **8** lanes (a constant); selected = ink fill (law 5). The date chip, **preset to today** when the sheet opens (review): the first block's `occurred` annotation as one removable chip that is also the editor — a date, `+ add time` inside it for the optional clock, an optional end (H20c); its × clears it for a plain posted block. `+ Add Image` — camera or gallery; thumbnails preview above the commit row. No session field: sessions are date-based (review), and a custom shelf takes a post from its own picker or the post's header menu.
- **Commit row**: a single full-width **Drop**. Blue means action; the Drop is the one blue thing on the sheet.
- **A single line with no Enter commits as an untitled post** whose line is its first block — a line typed into the title alone, with nothing under it and no photo, is that line: the dump posture is preserved (a judgment call on dogfood review). Text-only, photo-only and chip-only commits are valid; nothing at all is the one thing that is not.
- After commit the sheet closes and the **ripple ring plays once at the new post's pill** on the ground — transform and opacity only, no ambient loop, skipped under reduced motion: the signature moment. The pill is seated the moment Drop is pressed, before the server has the post (every edit, add and delete is optimistic; CLAUDE.md). No praise, no share prompts.

**Writing on the page** (section 5, the post's page): tapping a block edits it in place; the add slot at the bottom starts a new block; the title, the declared date and the declared lane are edited in place from the header. A new block defaults to the declared date and lane (H21f). Not editable anywhere: `created_at` (H17).

*Retired (H21):* the ripple sheet, the splash sheet, `+ Add to Splash`, the ripple detail half-sheet (the lock toggle lives in the block editor now, H20g's intent kept: audience sits beside the record where it is read). *Dormant (H20b, H20c):* the Timer and the dual commit, the running-session swap, the straddle refusal, the ghost landing rail, inner composition, the collision repair, and the old ripple sheet the focus screen hosts. Their modules and tests stay for P3's Swim.

## 7. Visual system

Theme: swimming pool. Stop before skeuomorphism: no wave textures, no floats, no water puns in copy.

**Laws:**
1. **Time owns the tone and opacity channels.** On the ground, **within a month, time reads downward**: the top is the month's start, the bottom is now, and the bottom edge is the present-and-writing zone (today's posts, the pinned bar, the FAB). **The past recedes along the month scrubber**, fading with distance — that is where sinking lives on Home (H21d). On the white continuous scrolls (the Trail, Lanes) backgrounds still sink stepwise (white, then #F1F3F7, then #D8DCE8) going deeper as you move back through one surface; a paged view is not a section and keeps its ground (H14). Tone and opacity never encode ownership (mine vs others).
2. **Undulation = activity.** More waves = more happened. Impression-level (calm / some / lots), log-scaled, never a precise count or a participation gauge. A bundle's count is an impression and nothing finer: it does not represent breaks or any other structure inside a session, because information below an encoding's resolution reads as a defect (H15a2).
3. **Only living things move.** An in-progress timed **travels**: its waveform is held rigid and slid through a clipped window, every line in the bundle in phase, so what moves is the water and not the drawing of it (H9). Finished water is still. New drop = a **ripple: three rings spreading outward, staggered**, their opacity front-loaded against their travel (H9c) — one event per commit, never a loop. **One stated exception**: the ghost ring at the head of a list ripples continuously — the invitation is the one still thing that moves, because it is the seat of the next living thing. reduced-motion fallback mandatory, and every design must read correctly static.
4. **Dotted = not yet.** Lane ropes and the empty "your lane" slot. **Not planned Ripples** (H9b): at the wave's 1px amplitude a dashed stroke becomes a row of dots and stops reading as a wave, so planned renders at reduced opacity instead.
5. **One channel, one meaning.** Position = me (first column/row, leading). Ring weight + #0507C9 = live. **Two fills, two meanings (H20f): solid #0507C9 fill = action** — Drop, +Drop, the FAB, waves; **solid ink #161621 fill = selection** — the selected chip, the selected lane header, the pinned bar. White text on both. The Sessions tab's current month reads in #0507C9 text, no fill. **On the blue ground the channels invert (H21c)**: Home's ground *is* solid #0507C9 — the water, not a session — so white carries content and action there (post pills, waves as data) and ink stays selection; the live-session meaning of a solid #0507C9 *content* surface is kept only by the dormant live surfaces (H15). Blue fills on a white screen point only at what commits or creates. Chrome styling is not encoding, so the action colour does not compete for the channel (H8).
6. **Vocabulary may be taught; visual encodings may not.** If an encoding needs explanation, it is rejected.

**Palette (the only custom tokens):**
- Main ramp: **#0507C9** is the whole of it in practice — waves, live states, emphasis text and interactive chrome. **#787BE2** is a chip foreground only (H8). **#D3D7F6** is **reserved and currently unused** (H9a): the wave vitality ramp it belonged to no longer exists, because a wave keeps its strength wherever it sits and the past is carried by the sinking background instead.
- Gray ramp, structure: **#F1F3F7** surfaces, **#D8DCE8** deeper surfaces / dividers / lane ropes, **#6B79A3** muted and secondary text.
- Ink: **#161621** body text (retokened from #313338 at the refounding review).
- **Text rule (H8):** #787BE2 is a **chip foreground and a wave tone, nothing else**. Its only text use is the foreground of small tag-like chips (the duration chip); otherwise it appears solely as the "recent" tone inside the wave ramp. Text hierarchy: **#161621** default, **#0507C9** emphasis, **#6B79A3** muted or secondary. #D3D7F6 is never text. Enforced by `scripts/check-tokens.sh`, which fails the lint if main-400 is used outside the chip and wave components.
- **Chips (H20f):** a category chip is white with muted text when unselected and an **ink fill with white text** when selected; an outline chip (a splash's lane chips) is never filled. Blue fill is never a selection.
- **No other colors, with one exception: category emojis keep their native colors** (the only off-palette element).
- Dark mode: undefined for now. When designed it must be a night pool, never inverted colors.

**Wave colour is contrast-determined (H15c, generalised by H21c):** #0507C9 on light surfaces, white on the blue ground. An inversion rule, not a second tone — one wave drawn in whatever reads against its ground, carried by `--wave-ink` so the surface decides and the component never takes a colour. A white pill on the ground sets it back to blue inside itself.

**Ripple grammar:** timed = multi-line wave bundle (line count log-scaled on duration, capped at 10; **constant gap between lines, so only the count varies** — a bundle's height is a consequence of its density, not a measure of its span). drop = single wave line. A post's **wave mark** = its block count on the log scale (law 2), drawn inside a ring at the pill's right end; its page carries the same count as a wave underline under the title; a lane header's waves are its post count this month. A post with nothing in it yet draws one line so it has a mark at all. Planned-at-reduced-opacity is retired (H20c): a future-dated block is a normal block with a future date chip. Category badge on the avatar corner (rows) or bundle head (timeline), so text is 100% note. Display format: `category · note`.

**Design system follows Tailwind conventions:** spacing, radius, and type use the default scale; the three ramps above are the only custom tokens.

occurred vs created separated (backfill lands on the right day); occurred_on and occurred_time are author-local, day boundaries computed in the author's timezone. **The display key is `COALESCE(occurred, the post's declared date, created_at)`** and the day Locker and Lanes read is `COALESCE(occurred_on, declared_start, created_at in the author's zone)` (H20c, H21f), computed where it is read; no sort key is stored. Monthly session membership is derived from a post's display range (declared ∪ block-derived) and never stored (H21e). Swim = a grouping of simultaneous timed Ripples. RLS enforces the two visibility paths at the DB level.

## 9. Scope

Scope is cut into **phases**, not versions (H11). The build is solo-first: the app becomes complete for one person before anyone is invited, because the founding constraint is that a user is complete with zero pools and the archive is worth keeping with nobody watching.

*Mapping, stated once:* the old v1a splits across **P1** (everything except the social half) and **P2** (Link, rail, view count, presence). Old v1b's Lanes matrix moves into P1; its Spotify suggestion into P1.5; Home Weekly is deferred. Old v1.5 becomes **P3** unchanged. The v1a/v1b/v1.5 labels are retired.

**P1 — solo-complete.** Auth (social login) + profile bootstrap (timezone capture, six-lane seed); **the refounding (H21)**: the post sheet (section 6); Home as the water ground scoped by month; the post's page with in-place writing; Sessions (derived monthly shelves, custom shelves, the shelf view, the sessions sheet); pinned posts; inheritance as defaults; delete (hard, including media and blocks); photo attach; designed empty-state copy; Locker Trail (full personal scroll including locked blocks); deploy to cloud Supabase + Vercel, because daily use on a phone requires it. *Dormant, kept for P3:* the Timer, the now band, the focus screen, Break, inner ripples.

**P1.5 — dogfood window.** Daily personal use and small fixes. First candidate: Spotify now-playing as a client-side fetch when the input sheet opens — no background jobs, no stored tokens.

**P2 — Link world.** Link + invite link, friend rail, the audience chip back in the sheet, **Splash shared by two**, view-count UI (opening a Ripple records a view event; the count is visible to the author only), presence TTL surfacing (hardcoded 3d, computed at read). **The witnessing experiment runs here**: the section 1 hypotheses about being witnessed are not answerable before an audience exists.

**What each phase can conclude (H11).** P1 and P1.5 validate **input cost and recall value only** — whether a record is cheap enough to make, and whether the archive is worth returning to. **Solo usage decay is not evidence of product failure**, because the witnessed hook is absent by design until P2.

**P3 — Pool world.** Pool create/join + mapping contract screen, Swimmers (Daily score / Weekly matrix), pool Lanes, **Splash pool-wide** (the compound pool pill, the joint filter, the sharing record carrying `pool_lane_id`), Swim (lane card, live card, FAB entry — the dormant live modules wake here), suggestion row full version.

**Later, unscheduled:** Home Weekly zoom, one year ago today (empty by definition for the first 12 months), background auto-collection (timeline autofill; Spotify first), multi-pool routing UI (category x pool mapping settings), Lists UI, notifications (Splash opened / Swim started / Link request only; <= 2/day), Splash-born ephemeral pools, open/searchable pools, desktop score layout and ambient window, weekly-group view for couples (Splash grouping), recurrence engine, note-convention parsing (scores), photo book export, dark mode (night pool), TTL setting UI.

### 5.8 Empty states

One voice: **invitation, never absence, never a nudge** (H19). No exclamation marks, no counts of what is missing, no "yet" that implies a debt. An empty month on the ground: *A fresh page of water.* — in white, with the FAB as the only call (H21). A shelf with nothing on it: *Nothing shelved here.* Lanes with nothing recorded at all: *Waves gather here as you drop.* An empty Trail: *Your trail starts with the first ripple.* *(Retired: A quiet day so far / A quiet day / Nothing planned yet (H20c); Your trail starts with the first ripple on Home, and Stories gather what keeps happening (H21).)*

## 10. Open items

- Onboarding flow beyond functional empty states (first drop before first invite; "everyone's submerged" roster copy).
- Home-Lanes-Detail person/pool filter chips in mockup: undecided whether that view includes others' content (would be a new axis decision) or is mine-only (then remove chips).
- Friend-rail wave unification; quiet-day row compression thresholds.
- Swim focus screen: lane card enlarged + my timer, nothing more (one-liner, P3).
- **A future-dated block places its post at the bottom of the ground** (H20c, H21d): the present-and-writing zone takes it. Accepted for now and a dogfood watch item: if plans crowd the bottom, the fallback is a plans shelf. Lanes already leaves them out of cell counts.
- **The untitled single-line post (H21).** A line with no Enter is a post with no title; the dump posture is kept on purpose. Dogfood decides whether untitled posts pile up into noise or stay the fast path.
- **The status bar on the ground.** The viewport's theme colour stays white app-wide; Home's blue ground meets a white status bar in the installed app. Revisit if it reads as a band.
- *Dormant with the live surfaces (H20b):* **Timed inner ripples, partly settled (H18).** Inner mode has **no Timer**, not "Drop only": a typed span is allowed inside a session, validated by containment, so a backfilled break or a call taken during a focus block can be recorded with its own span. That answers the old open question about arbitrary timed children in the retroactive direction, and it settles the break-identity worry the safe way round — **breaks were identified by span rather than by name, and that still holds**, but a break is no longer the *only* timed child, so "a timed inner ripple" and "a break" are no longer the same set. What remains open: whether a timed child may ever be started live and outlive its parent, and whether two timed children may overlap inside one parent (today's containment and the exclusion constraint say no to both).
- *Dormant with the live surfaces (H20b):* **Detach is deliberately absent.** An inner ripple cannot be promoted to top-level by moving it out of its parent: its time is clamped to the parent's span, and the way out is delete and re-drop. Composition is a decision made when the record is written, not a later re-filing, and a detach control would put a second structural verb next to the three that already exist (drop, timer, break). Revisit only if dogfooding produces the need.
- E2EE stance: rejected in favor of access control (RLS); revisit only if positioning changes.
- Monetization: explicitly a non-goal (portfolio + personal use).
