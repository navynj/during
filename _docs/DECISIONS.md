# During: Decision Log (v0.12)

Format: **Decision** · Why · Rejected (and why). Grouped by theme, roughly chronological within each. Group H records spec-review amendments; where H supersedes an earlier entry, the earlier entry stays as history with a note.

---

## A. Concept

**A1. Closed-group app, not a social network.** Numbers-free (no likes/rankings/streaks) is the identity, not a feature. Rejected: any engagement mechanics; they reintroduce broadcast psychology. (Reframed by H1: now a hypothesis set to validate with the MVP, not a dogma.)

**A2. Chat is excluded on purpose.** Can't beat KakaoTalk; including it makes archiving a side feature. Reactions were later removed too. Rejected: chat tab, reply threads. (Reframed by H1.)

**A3. Survive next to KakaoTalk by not competing for conversation.** Value = data chat doesn't have (location, time, originals, structure), value that grows with time, and utility even when others are quiet.

**A4. Church small-group product: deprioritized.** Leader-motivated / member-cost tools collapse in 3 to 4 weeks; archives of prayer lists have no compounding value. Kept only as a Pool preset.

**A5. Realtime micro-sharing chosen over archiving-first.** Presence has near-zero production cost ("existing is the signal") and fills the gap chat structurally can't (status is not addressing someone).

**A6. Reward = being witnessed, not interaction.** Must hold with zero response from others. View count only, never viewer lists. (Count-only display is now hypothesis H1-b.)

**A7. Pivot: input-based SNS to self-record with leakage.** Chip-tapping "for broadcast" felt meaningless (user diagnosis). Frame flipped: a dot on my Trail; friends seeing it is a byproduct. Rejected: productivity-tool core (todo/timer as the engine: tone too narrow, non-purposeful states die), permanent standing-Splash-first (records without a matching board still homeless).

**A8. Timeline day-page diary (Structured-like plan+check allowed) adopted as the core form.** The empty time axis itself invites filling; morning planning prepays the day's record; the time axis doesn't discriminate rest vs work (unlike todo's completion axis). Conditions: dual path (planning optional, drop-only valid), unchecked plans fade without guilt.

**A9. Timeline format presupposes auto-collection.** Quiet-day emptiness must read as "quiet", not "dead": auto signals (Spotify first) + plans filling the future + copy. Promoted from v2 to v1.

**A10. Diary posture, not chat posture.** No persistent bottom input bar, flat rows (no bubbles), generous spacing, day pagination not infinite scroll. Chat contributes only its grammar (single time axis, author labels, cardinality-adaptive rendering). (Amended by H2: the original "newest on top" ordering is replaced by chronological top-to-bottom with a current-time anchor for today; the intent, opening onto the latest, is preserved by the anchor.)

**A11. All records belong to the time they were born.** Date-only records sit in that view's Note area (several per day allowed, per H5); week/month notes on their period views (recursive rule). Timeless documents are out of scope: "want to become X" is a record of the day you thought it. Rejected: undated notes area (turns the app into a general notebook).

## B. Vocabulary

**B1. English service; vocabulary is a budgeted system.** Skeleton nav uses common words (Home), custom words only where meaning would be lost otherwise. Encodings must be intuitive without teaching; words may be taught.

**B2. Final glossary:** Ripple (record; drop/timed), Splash (board), Swim (session), Pool (group), Lobby (pool browser), Lanes (category axis), Swimmers (pool people view), Locker (recall), Submerge (presence expiry), Link, List. Retired: Table, Pan, Event, Moment, Log, Stream, Deck.

**B3. Ripple unified as the name for every remaining record** (statuses, pool posts, logs). One vocabulary = one schema table. "The wave while it spreads is the status; what remains is the Ripple."

**B4. Lane belongs to the category axis; Swimmers names the people view.** Three rounds: person-exclusive (metaphor literalism), then reverted. A lane is a division of one pool of water; the category IS that division's meaning; identical form because identical nature. Lane then appears at both levels (asset placed where most seen). Swimmers reads as a scene (people swimming), not a roster. swim-root = activity words, lane-root = space words.

**B5. Stream rejected twice.** As category name: tech smell, then displaced by Lanes. As Home name: it names the feed form this app deliberately killed; flow is expressed by the screen's physics, the tab names the place. Retired words stay retired.

**B6. Locker never reused for categories.** One word = one axis. Categories' jobs are index/routing/declaration, not storage; storage is Locker's alone.

**B7. Naming: During kept (concept word: duration/simultaneity; theme is a replaceable skin, name is structural). Dive rejected (active plunge is not quiet floating). Budget app renamed Namjit.** Domain: during.today (first-year cheap, renewal acceptable, TLD reads as a sentence); auto-renew off; premium C$114 alternative dropped.

## C. Graph & privacy

**C1. Mutual-only Link.** No follower asymmetry = no audience accumulation = graph-level anti-SNS.

**C2. Two-layer social model: flows are person-based (Link+List), artifacts are room-based (Pool).** Pure ego-model rejected: shared artifacts (Splash/Swim/boards) need a common reference "us" that private labels can't provide.

**C3. Link and Pool membership are independent.** Groupmates need not be friends. Non-friend member sees only in-pool leaks; their profile view is a dead end + Link request. Tables never joined to imply friendship.

**C4. List-scoped artifacts rejected.** Reproduces the missing-common-reference bug (invitees can't see "who is us"). Alternative adopted: a Splash can spawn a lightweight ephemeral Pool; the List is consumed as an invite roster only; success path = promote to a real Pool.

**C5. Leak, not publish.** Publish = per-record audience decision = friction + curation pressure. Default flow with valves instead. Then corrected: **explicit category-to-lane mapping is the precondition of any leak** (name-coincidence must not route data; "Day" in two pools are different contexts). Personal and group vocabularies stay independent via mapping.

**C6. Join screen = privacy contract.** Result-phrased ("these will flow here"), match suggestions pre-checked except residual categories (default unchecked; nudge to create a dedicated category), zero-mapping lurker join is first-class with no warning copy, "change later" visible.

**C7. Submerge redefined as universal TTL.** Not a mode: presence expires N after last update (instant/1/3/7d, default 3d). Manual submerge = "expire now" shortcut. Display: the row disappears entirely; no "submerged" badge anywhere (plausible deniability is the point). Past Ripples and pool contributions persist: expiry of "now-ness", not deletion. Not stored as a flag; computed at render.

**C8. Per-drop audience spectrum:** everyone, lists/pools, only me. Lock is one end, not a separate feature. Locker sees all. "Public is ephemeral (presence), private is permanent" became "presence expires, records persist, per-drop lock guards curation pressure."

## D. IA & views

**D1. Everything derives from one primitive.** Splash = Ripple collection, Swim = plural timed, Locker = Ripple aggregation. Complexity lives in surface area, not concepts.

**D2. View formula: time (rows) x entity (columns) x waves (cells); only the column binding changes.** Lanes = categories, Swimmers-Weekly = people, Home-Weekly = weekdays (degenerate single-entity case).

**D3. Tabs split by errand, not by ownership; toggles only for same-errand cross-sections.** Led to top-level Home / Lanes / Pools / Locker (zoom-axis unification of Daily-Weekly-Lanes rejected: zoom is magnification, not axis swap; then toggle rejected too: different errands, discoverability) and pool-level Swimmers / Lanes / Splash. Tab slots are now full: future tab demands auto-reject.

**D4. Home is top-level, not inside a Pool.** Record unit = my day (diary pivot); Link-only users must be complete with zero pools. Pool = a room my records leak into.

**D5. Swim has no tab.** Frequency-area inverse rule. Start = FAB sheet + lane long-press; live = large intruding card (carousel peek); past = absorbed by Splash tab (joint-Ripple definition covers ended swims) + simultaneous-bundle traces in Swimmers.

**D6. Splash tab = boards + all joint Ripples (participants >= 2).** "Records of us" filter; the Us-column need lands here. Global cross-pool Splash feed rejected (artifact-room principle + feed resurrection + empty for Link-only users); its real need decomposed into Pools-tab activity badges + notifications.

**D7. Group weekly = person-column matrix (Lanes grammar, column binding swapped).** Earlier "no group weekly" verdict was a rendering error (imagined a content grid). Column order: me first + join order (activity-order = implicit ranking, rejected). Quiet-within-TTL = calm column; past-TTL = no column.

**D8. Day page: stream to today page with pager.** One pager governs the whole page; boards get their own only when expanded. Later Home Daily/Weekly + rail finalized; category board demoted to a resident summary strip, then split out to the Lanes tab.

**D9. Us/Message are not categories.** "With whom" = participants (overlapping avatars; render rule per group type), "to whom" = at most a future marker. Couple preset: Food / Place / Fun / Day (concrete nouns beat abstractions; Fun = enjoy-by-doing included; Day = guilt-free residual is a culture declaration). Boardgame-with-scores: Fun + note convention ("120:106"), schema fields rejected.

**D10. Locker = recall engine, Lanes = exploration.** Weekly recap (score view), aggregates, one year ago, export live in Locker; matrices don't. Mutual erosion forbidden.

**D11. PC version is coverage, not port.** Desk half of life (focus, Lane sessions, Spotify) happens where the phone is face-down; width solves the compression dilemmas; v1 = responsive web only, ambient window v2.

## E. Input

**E1. Preset chips = category layer, free text = detail layer.** category (enum) + note split is what makes Locker aggregation possible; presets also declare culture (resting equals focus in rank). Chip alone = valid zero-character entry.

**E2. drop/timed split: duration is claimed, never inferred.** Drops display "dropped Xm ago", never elapsed. Fake-duration TTL rejected. Category carries a default mode. (Restated by H18: what E2 rejected was **system-fabricated** duration — a TTL that decides on the author's behalf how long something lasted. A span the author types in is not that; it is an explicit claim, the same claim a timer makes, made after the fact. The original wording said "only explicit timers claim duration", which read the prohibition as being about the timer rather than about fabrication.)

**E3. Dual commit buttons (Drop / Timer) replace long-press mode flip.** No hidden gesture, no mode state; choice deferred to commit moment. Future time disables the timer.

**E4. Ghost landing + suggestion row are the sheet's direction.** Form-submission feel rejected: direct manipulation (ghost wave lands where it will live) + reaction-not-recall (now playing / location / yesterday's repeat for one-tap re-drop). Habits are served by re-drop suggestions, not a recurrence engine (Repeat button removed) and never by streaks.

**E5. Single note field.** Title/content split rejected (document smell). Time editing is edge UI ("change the time and it becomes a plan"). After commit: one ring, no praise.

**E6. Three entry points, one sheet, prefill only** (FAB blank / lane = category / timeline slot = time).

## F. Visual system

**F1. Pool theme adopted; depth = time is the systemic value** (theme as information hierarchy, not decoration). Stop before skeuomorphism; no water puns in copy; dark mode = designed night pool.

**F2. Undulation = activity, generalized to "only living things move".** Wave counts are impressions (calm/some/lots, log-scaled, cap), never gauges (blue progress bars rejected as participation-tracking backdoor).

**F3. Timed = wave bundle, drop = single wave line.** Capsule blocks rejected (Structured's signature + calendar-partition metaphor vs water physics); line-thickness "water column" superseded by the user's wave-bundle sketch (one shape, quantity difference; board and timeline finally share one language). Bundle span = duration span. (Superseded by H9/H10 practice and SPEC v0.8: the gap between lines is constant, so a bundle's height follows its line count. Duration is read from density and the duration chip, and the axis is ordered rather than time-proportional.)

**F4. One channel, one meaning.** Depth/opacity = time (never mine/others), position = me (first row/column), dotted = not-yet (ropes, plans, empty lane), ring weight + live accent = live, solid deep surface = Swim/Splash cards only. Avatar corner badge / bundle head carries category so text is pure note. Mine/others by opacity rejected ("nobody would understand" = the rejection criterion, promoted to principle). (Color values superseded by H3.)

**F5. Sunken sections + ripple ring feedback.** Day sections sink stepwise; new drop = one expanding ring settling to one; reduced-motion fallback required. (Color values superseded by H3.)

## G. Scope & stack

**G1. v1 cut by the core loop verbs: write / witnessed / recall.** Link world first (auth, Link, input sheet, Home Daily+Weekly waves, rail, Lanes stub, Locker Trail + one year ago, TTL hardcoded, Spotify). Pool world v1.5 (join contract, Swimmers, pool Lanes, Splash, Swim). v2+: routing UI, Lists UI, notifications (<=2/day; Splash/Swim/Link only), ephemeral pools, open pools, desktop layouts, recurrence, exports. (v1 internals restructured by H6 into v1a/v1b.)

**G2. Feature chains that stayed out of v1 stayed out.** Multi-pool audience routing, List artifacts, global feeds: each explored, mapped, reserved; the v1 line never moved. Open/searchable pools removed from the create screen (stranger-world costs uncontracted).

**G3. Stack: responsive web (Vercel) + Supabase.** Neon rejected (DB-only; Auth/Storage/Realtime/RLS would become assembly work; leak-model visibility enforced via RLS). Free-tier slot limit handled by local-first dev (`supabase start`) + slot cleanup (dump and delete dead projects / second free org). Pro plan only if paths close.

**G4. Not a business.** Personal use + portfolio (Ashby design-engineer case study). Korean real users + English UI + English demo seed data; ko/en copy layer if a church group onboards. The exploration record itself (sketch iterations, this log) is portfolio material.

## H. Spec-review amendments (v0.2)

**H1. "Non-negotiables" section dissolved.** Product prohibitions (no likes/comments/rankings/streaks/follower counts; view count only; no chat; no feed; no guilt devices) demoted to MVP-validated hypotheses, each with a decide-by signal. Why: a document's authority should come from rationale, not labels, and the asymmetry favors testing (adding later is cheap, removing later is nearly impossible; shipping without them IS the experiment). System rules (categories = "what" only, per-Ripple assignment, note conventions over schema, encodings never taught) redistributed into their operating sections.

**H2. Home axis and anchors finalized.** Timeline runs chronologically top to bottom (early to late); new records append at the flow's end, where an "Add ripple" ghost slot sits as the next seat and input entry. Scroll anchors: today opens at the current time (scroll up = earlier), any other day opens at the top, pager moves reset anchors. Supersedes A10's "newest on top" while preserving its intent (opening shows the latest today). Friend rail: far right, sharing the main axis's time coordinates.

**H3. Palette v2.** Main ramp #0507C9 / #898BE3 / #D3D7F6 = content vitality (live / recent / settled); gray ramp #F1F3F7 / #D8DCE8 / #6B79A3 = structure, sinking backgrounds, dividers, muted text; ink #313338 = body text. Role remap: live accent and Swim/Splash solid surfaces = #0507C9; sinking backgrounds white to #F1F3F7 to #D8DCE8. #898BE3 and lighter never used for text (contrast). Design system follows Tailwind conventions: default scale for spacing/radius/type; the three ramps are the only custom tokens. Dark mode deferred (night pool when designed; inversion forbidden). (Mid tone and text rule corrected by H7.)

**H4. Emoji exception.** Category emojis keep their native colors: the single allowed off-palette element. Resolves the emoji-vs-icon open item in favor of emojis.

**H5. Date-only records: several per day.** Stacked in the Daily/Weekly Note area under the header (not a single one-line caption). Future-time items render dotted at reduced opacity: time owns the tone and opacity channels in both directions (past sinks, future fades).

**H6. v1 restructured into v1a / v1b (loop-first).** v1a = the smallest set that closes write / witnessed / recall with real friends: auth + profile bootstrap (timezone, category seed), Link + invite, input sheet with ghost landing, Home Daily + rail, Ripple mini half-sheet with view count (new table ripple_views; the witnessed half of the loop was missing from the list), hard delete (privacy requires recall of misfires), designed empty states, TTL hardcoded, Locker Trail. v1b = Home Weekly, read-only Lanes, Spotify reduced to a client-side now-playing fetch when the sheet opens (background OAuth polling infrastructure deferred; the sheet suggestion is most of the value), suggestion-row re-drop. Cut from v1: one year ago today (empty by definition for the first 12 months). A hypothesis checkpoint follows v1a: 4 to 6 weeks of real use, section 1 hypotheses reviewed against their signals, logged as group I before v1.5.

**H7. Palette mid tone corrected: #898BE3 to #787BE2; the "never text" rule retracted.** The prohibition was a contrast inference stated as a decision; the color was always intended for text. Scoped rule instead: #787BE2 = accent text (labels, time markers, headings, bold or generous sizes; ~3.7:1 on white passes large-text contrast), body copy stays #313338 / #6B79A3, #D3D7F6 never text. One-channel-one-meaning is unaffected: the vitality encoding lives in waves; accent text is styling, not encoding.

**H8. Palette scoped again, and law 5 split into content vs chrome.** Two corrections found while building the shell.

(a) **#787BE2 is a chip foreground and a wave tone, not an accent text color.** H7 retracted the "never text" prohibition and over-corrected into a general accent-text allowance; in practice it spread onto headings, time markers and nav chrome, which is precisely the diffusion one-channel-one-meaning exists to prevent. Scoped rule: #787BE2's only text use is the foreground of category chips and other small tag-like chips; otherwise it appears solely as the "recent" tone inside the wave ramp. Text hierarchy is #313338 (default), #0507C9 (emphasis), #6B79A3 (muted); #D3D7F6 is never text. Enforced mechanically by `scripts/check-tokens.sh`, which fails the lint if main-400 appears outside `components/ui/chips/` and `components/ui/waves/`. Supersedes H7's text rule; H7's hex correction stands.

(b) **Law 5 amended: solid #0507C9 is reserved as a *content* surface, not as an action color.** The original rule ("solid #0507C9 surface = Swim/Splash cards only") was written about content and then read as a blanket prohibition, which left the FAB and primary buttons with nowhere to go. Split: solid #0507C9 *content* surfaces remain reserved for live Swim/Splash cards, where the fill encodes liveness; interactive chrome (FAB, primary action buttons, active nav) may use solid #0507C9 as the action color. Chrome styling is not encoding, so it does not compete for the channel. Rejected: inventing a separate action color, which would have added a fourth ramp to a three-ramp system to solve a problem of wording.

**H9. The wave grammar after S1: tone deleted, dotted narrowed, one ring becomes a ripple.** Three rulings settled while building `components/ui/waves/`; each was a correction made against a rendered page, not on paper.

(a) **The tone axis is deleted from waves. Vitality is state alone.** Waves are always #0507C9: `active` animates, `done` is still, `planned` fades. Draining color out of a wave to say "this is old" duplicated a channel law 1 had already assigned — past is expressed by the section background sinking, and nothing else. The wave keeps its strength wherever it sits. Consequence: **#D3D7F6 becomes a reserved token with no current consumer**, and #787BE2's only remaining use is the chip foreground H8 scoped it to. Rejected: keeping a three-tone ramp "for later", which is how an unused encoding survives long enough to be reintroduced by accident.

(b) **Law 4 narrows: dotted belongs to lane ropes and the empty "your lane" slot. Planned Ripples render at reduced opacity, not dashed.** Found by rendering it: at the wave's 1px amplitude a dashed stroke turns the line into a row of dots and it stops reading as a wave at all. "Dotted = not yet" still holds for the structures it was written about; it was never tested against a stroke this small.

(c) **The commit feedback is a multi-ring ripple — three rings, staggered — replacing "one expanding ring that settles to a single ring".** One ring read as a pulse emitted by the control; several reading outward read as water displaced by something that landed. The rings' opacity is front-loaded against their travel so the figure spends quickly rather than being traced to the edge. Law 3 is unaffected: still one event per commit, no loop, reduced-motion fallback mandatory.

**Closed (was H9 item 4): how an in-progress timed shows it is alive.** **The whole bundle travels, waveform rigid.** Both modes were built and judged on the real Home Daily axis rather than on a fixture page. `grow` is **rejected: it stretches the waveform** (the objection that produced ruling 10) — the exported geometry is what makes a wave read as a wave, and scaling it to 45% and back makes the shape the thing that moves rather than the water. Travel also reads correctly among still records: the whole bundle moving in phase says *this record is running*, where one line moving inside a settled stack said *that line is broken*. `grow` is deleted with the call, along with its prop, its keyframes and the `?motion=` override that existed to make it; keeping the losing mode is how an unused encoding survives long enough to be reintroduced by accident (H9a). Rejected: keeping both behind a setting — motion is an encoding, and law 6 says encodings may not be taught, so two of them for one state is worse than either.


**H10. Timeline exclusivity, and inner ripples.** A day is one axis, so **one author's top-level Ripples never overlap in time**. Concurrency is expressed as containment instead: a record that happens during a timed span is an **inner ripple** — `parent_ripple_id` set — a full Ripple with its own category and note, so Locker aggregation still counts it.

Why a constraint and not a convention. The axis has one row per moment; two records claiming the same minute have no honest rendering, and a rule the database does not hold is a rule the next feature breaks. Enforced with a `btree_gist` exclusion constraint over `tstzrange(started_at, ended_at)` per author, scoped to top-level, non-planned rows. Half-open bounds, so back-to-back records touching at an endpoint are adjacent and not concurrent; a drop is a **point** range rather than an empty one, because a point inside a session *is* inside it and an empty range would overlap nothing.

**Planned Ripples are exempt.** Intentions are allowed to collide — two plans for 19:00 is a normal way to think — and the clash is resolved when one is checked, not when it is written. Forcing plans to be exclusive would turn the morning's planning into a scheduling puzzle, which A8 explicitly did not want.

**Corollary, free from the same rule: at most one in-progress timer per user.** A running timer's span runs to infinity, so nothing top-level can follow it until it stops. The input sheet resolves a second Timer in one tap — stop the running one and start this one — rather than reporting the constraint's refusal.

**Where an inner ripple is created (S3 revision).** Not from the input sheet. The sheet briefly offered "add to this session" as a proactive toggle; it was removed because it made every record a question about the session, and because an inner ripple belongs to a parent that the author should be looking at when they file into it. The entry point is the **parent Ripple's detail sheet** (S5). The input sheet keeps one path to a parent — the repair offered when a write is refused for colliding with a session — which is a fix for a rejected record, not a way of composing one.

**Inner ripples inherit the parent's audience in v1a**, enforced in `ripple_is_locked`, which now walks to the parent — without that, a friend would see the contents of a locked session. They must lie within the parent's span, they are one level deep, and they do not appear on the top-level axis; their display arrives with the mini sheet in S5.

**Vocabulary.** A child is an **inner ripple** — lowercase modifier, the same register as drop and timed. Top-level Ripples stay unmarked: they are just Ripples, and "top-level" is a technical contrast term for constraint language only. There is no "outer ripple". No UI noun ships in v1a; the sheet's entry point is verb-phrased ("Add to this session"). **"Thread" remains banned** as a UI noun — it collides with the no-chat hypothesis (A2, H1).

`started_at` is stored rather than derived: `occurred_on` + `occurred_time` are an author-local wall clock and the zone lives on the profile, so the instant cannot be computed inside a constraint. Resolving it once at write time also means a later timezone change does not move records that already happened.

**H11. Build order re-cut around solo-first. Phases replace the v1a session plan.** *(Decided outside the repo and synced late; briefly filed as H15 before being moved to the number it was reserved under.)*

- **P1 — solo-complete.** S3's input sheet; then the Ripple mini half-sheet **without the view count**, hard delete, photo attach, final empty-state copy; then the read-only Lanes matrix and the Locker Trail; then deploy — cloud Supabase promotion and Vercel — because daily use on a phone requires it. P1 is the app being complete for one person.
- **P1.5 — dogfood window.** Daily personal use and small fixes. First candidate: the Spotify now-playing suggestion, fetched client-side when the sheet opens, no background jobs.
- **P2 — Link world.** Mutual Link and invite, the friend rail, the view-count UI, presence TTL surfacing. **The witnessed-as-hook experiment runs here**, not in P1.
- **P3 — Pool world.** The former v1.5, unchanged.

Why solo first. The founding constraint is that a Link-only user must be complete with zero pools (D4) — and beneath it, that the archive has to be worth keeping with nobody watching (A6: the reward must hold with zero response from others). Solo dogfooding tests that constraint directly, which no amount of building the social half can. Friends' onboarding is also a one-shot resource: a person can be invited to a half-finished app once. Spending that invitation on a build that has not yet proven it is worth opening daily wastes the only cohort the experiment has.

**Verdict-split rule, so the dogfood window cannot be misread.** P1/P1.5 validate **input cost and recall value only** — is a record cheap enough to make, and is the archive worth returning to. **Solo usage decay must not be read as product failure.** The witnessed hook is absent by design in these phases, so its absence explains a decay that says nothing about the product with friends present. The section 1 hypotheses about witnessing are answerable only in P2.

**H12. The ghost lands in the sheet, on a compressed axis in its left rail.** Replaces SPEC 6's "the sheet must not cover the landing spot".

Why the old constraint had to go: the landing spot *moves* with the chosen time. A record placed at 07:00 and one placed at 23:00 sit at opposite ends of the day, so no fixed sheet height can keep both uncovered, and on a phone the constraint is simply unenforceable. It was a rule written for the common case that fails exactly when the time control is used, which is the moment it was meant to protect.

What survives is the intent: direct manipulation, the record visibly taking its place rather than being submitted to a form. The sheet carries a compressed today-axis in its left rail, always visible, and the ghost slides along it as the time or category changes. **Preview in the rail, arrival on the page:** on commit the sheet closes and the multi-ring ripple plays at the real row on the real timeline, scrolled into view if needed.

Constraint on the implementation, so this does not become two timelines: the rail is **not a second rendering**. Same wave components, same query for today's Ripples, a compressed density preset on the library. No duplicated state to keep in sync — the rail and the page read the same data, and the ghost is draft state that exists in one place.

**H13. The default-state sheet is chips, note, time toggle, commit. The landing rail is instrumentation.** Amends H12.

H12 made the rail always visible, and first use showed the cost: a narrow axis occupying a fifth of the sheet on every single record, most of which are dropped at the current minute and never touch the time at all. The rail answers a question the default case does not ask.

So it is **progressive**: hidden while the time is the one the sheet opened with, sliding in when the time control is engaged — the picker open, or a time set that is not that one — and retracting when the time returns to it. All-day shows no rail, because a record with no time has no position to preview.

This follows the same rule as the time control itself: **defaults work, edges are touched.** The common record is a chip and a commit; everything else is reached for. H12's direct-manipulation intent is unharmed — the ghost still lands on a real axis, at exactly the moment the author is choosing where it lands.

**The rail also becomes the collision-anticipation surface.** A chosen time inside an existing span highlights that bundle in the rail, so the exclusion constraint (H10) is visible before it refuses rather than only after. Computed client-side: the answer changes with every tick of the picker, and a round trip per tick would lag the thumb.

**Time is one control with two exclusive segments** — a time, or All day — using the selection grammar the category chips use (solid #0507C9, white text), so "chosen" looks the same everywhere in the sheet. Replaces the prose links "For the whole day" / "Give it a time", which read as two separate commands rather than two states of one thing.

**The audience chip carries no avatar in v1a.** Two text states, Everyone and Only me. The avatar was off-palette and collided with the label, and it answered "who" when the chip's job is "how far" — the audience is a property of the record, not a picture of its readers. **Text-only, including the lock glyph**: a lone icon on one of two states is a second visual language inside one control. Revisit **at P2 entry, when audiences begin to exist** (H15) — the cost of getting lock wrong is a misfire, and a misfire is only expensive once there is someone to leak to. Through P1 and P1.5 there is no audience, so glanceability of the locked state buys nothing.

**H14. Law 1's sinking applies to sections within a scroll, not to a paged day.** Home Daily keeps a white ground at every date.

S2 read law 1 as "the further back the date, the deeper the page", and tinted the whole surface as the pager moved. In use it read wrong twice over. A fully tinted page looks *disabled*, not deep — the same grey the app uses for muted text and inert surfaces, now under everything. And the waves on it stay full-strength #0507C9 by H9a, so a past day became strong marks stranded on a dead ground, which is the opposite of settled.

The law was written about a continuous scroll: day sections stacked in one surface, going deeper as you move back through them. That is a real depth cue because the steps are *adjacent* and the eye reads them as one gradient. A pager shows one day at a time, so there are no adjacent steps to compare — only a page that is inexplicably grey today and white yesterday.

Sinking is therefore reserved for surfaces that actually stack sections: the Locker Trail's continuous scroll is where it belongs. Rejected: a fainter tint. The problem is not the strength of the step but that a single page has nothing to step against.

**H15. A running record gets two faces: a now band on the day, and a full-screen focus surface.** A timer is the one record that is still happening, and until now it rendered as an ordinary row with a ticking chip — a live thing wearing the clothes of a finished one.

**(a) Focus screen.** A running timed opens as a full-screen solid #0507C9 surface. Contents: a collapse control back to the day, a `category · note` chip, the elapsed time at display size, and slow white wave lines travelling across the surface. **Amends law 5's solid-surface reservation:** a solid #0507C9 *content* surface now means **a live session** — Swim and Splash cards, and this screen. The fill still encodes liveness; there is simply more than one thing that can be live.

*Explicitly absent, with reasons.* **Goal duration, percent complete, progress bar:** gauges, which F2 rejected outright, and targets, which the no-guilt hypothesis rejects — a session you meant to run for an hour and ran for twenty minutes is a record, not a failure. **Pause:** rejected, and replaced by **Break** (see below). The original reasons stand — `ended_at` is a single instant, a paused span would need intervals, and a timer that can be paused invites the accounting this app exists to avoid. **Co-swimmers row:** reserved for P2+, when other people exist. English copy only.

**(a2) Break replaces pause.** A break is a **timed inner ripple** — a child of the running session (H10) — that **inherits the parent's category**. No flag, no category of its own, no schema change.

A Break category was tried first, created lazily on first use. It then had to be hidden from the chip row, the Lanes strip and every picker, because a resident Break chip is a standing suggestion to take one. **A category that must be hidden from category surfaces is the wrong shape**: the hiding was the design telling us the thing was not a category.

Inheriting the parent's category makes the identity **structural instead of nominal**. Inner composition is Drop-only (SPEC 6), so the Break button on the focus screen is the only thing that produces a *timed* child — which means "a timed inner ripple" and "a break" are the same set, with nothing to label, rename or hide. (Loosened by H18: inner mode now has no Timer rather than no span, so a typed span may sit inside a session and a break is no longer the only timed child. Identification by span is unaffected — that is why it was chosen over a name.) Rejected: a boolean column, which is a flag for a distinction the structure already makes.

This keeps every reason pause was rejected. **The parent session is never split**: its span stays one interval, its duration chip stays **gross wall-clock**, and **no net time is displayed anywhere** — not on the chip, not on the focus screen, not in Lanes. The moment the app subtracts breaks from a session it has started keeping score of how much of your hour was *real*, which is the accounting the no-guilt hypothesis exists to refuse. What you get instead is a record of the break itself, which is a fact rather than a deduction.

One running break at a time, enforced in the UI rather than the schema — the exclusion constraint deliberately does not police inner ripples (H10), and a second concurrent break is a UI mistake, not a data one. **Stop during a break ends the break first, then the session, behind one confirm**: the order matters, because a parent's span shrinks to its end and a child still running would fall outside it.

**Rendering: calm water inside a bundle is rejected.** It was built and looked at, and it reads as a rendering defect — a bundle with a gap in it looks broken, not restful.

The reason is resolution. A bundle's wave count is already an *impression*: log-scaled and capped at ten, so a two-hour session and a three-hour one may draw the same number of lines. Removing a line to represent twenty minutes asks that encoding to carry information finer than it resolves, and information below an encoding's resolution does not read as subtle — it reads as noise, or as a bug. F2's "rest is the low value of the same channel" is true of the channel; it is not true of a scale this coarse.

So bundles and the now band draw **continuous waves regardless of inner ripples**. A break is still a record, and it surfaces where records are read in full — the Ripple detail sheet — not in a grammar built for impressions.

**Kept:** on the focus screen, the water stops travelling while a break runs. That reads as *state* rather than as absence: the waves are all still there, they have stopped moving, and the screen is showing one record at full size rather than a day at a glance.

**Rejected: a break as negative duration.** Recording rest as a signed span, so a session's total falls as it rests, fails three ways. Duration is **derived** from `started_at` and `ended_at` — there is no column to carry a sign, and inventing one to hold it would be the interval model pause was rejected for. A reversed span **breaks the invariants**: `tstzrange` requires its lower bound to precede its upper, so the exclusion constraint and the containment check would both refuse it. And a negative that subtracts from its parent is **net-time accounting** wearing a different hat — the scoring the no-guilt hypothesis exists to refuse.

**The honesty it aimed at gets the right fix: an aggregation rule.** When Locker's aggregates land, **duration sums count top-level Ripples only. Inner ripples contribute their count and their content, never their time.** A session that ran two hours contributes two hours whatever happened inside it, and a break inside it contributes a record rather than a subtraction. So sums **partition the wall clock**: nothing is counted twice, nothing goes negative, and "six hours of Focus this week" means six hours of clock — a claim that is true rather than flattering.

**(b) Now band.** On Home Daily the running record renders as a full-width solid #0507C9 band spanning the **entire row including the friend rail** — the shared time axis, made visible by the one record that is happening at this moment on it. Inside: white travelling waves, a white category badge, white note text, and a `Stop · <elapsed>` chip. **The band itself is perfectly still.** Liveness is expressed only by the waves, because law 3 licenses movement for living things, not for the furniture around them.

**(c) Wave colour is contrast-determined, not a tone.** #0507C9 on light surfaces, white on deep live surfaces. This is an inversion rule — one wave, drawn in whatever reads against its ground — and it does not reopen H9a's single-tone ruling. Implemented through `currentColor`, so the surface sets it and no component takes a colour prop.

**(d) Entry.** Tapping the band anywhere but the Stop chip, or tapping the running bundle, opens the focus screen. **Stop lives in exactly two places** — the band chip and the focus screen — and both sit behind a small confirm, because stopping writes an end that cannot be taken back. The old tap-the-duration-chip-to-stop on the timeline is removed: it put an irreversible write on the same gesture that now means "look closer".

**(e) Dogfood checkpoint.** If the resident band pulls peripheral attention while reading other records, the fallback is a light band — #F1F3F7 strip, blue waves — with identical structure. The band's surface is therefore a single token switch, so the fallback costs one line rather than a rewrite.

**(f) Banked, not built.** The solid live-session card with lane numbers, "Your Lane" and "Join Now" is the **Swim intrusion card** (D5), and is P3 design reference. It is not this screen.

**H16. The axis is ordered, not time-proportional.** *(Recorded as H11 on 2026-09-20 and renumbered the same week: H11 had been reserved outside the repo for the phase re-cut, which is where it now sits. Commit 39e1f3a still cites the old number.)* Vertical distance on Home Daily measures nothing. Time is carried by the order of records and by the start-time labels in the gutter; duration is carried by line density (log-scaled, capped) and the duration chip. F3's "bundle span = duration span" stopped being true when H9 fixed the gap between lines — height follows line count now — and SPEC 5.4 was still asserting it.

Why keep it ordered rather than restore proportion: a proportional axis spends its vertical budget on the parts of the day where nothing happened, and a single long session pushes the rest of the day off the screen. It also says duration twice, in the span and in the density, and the two disagree. Rejected: a proportional axis with collapsed empty stretches — that is a scale with holes in it, which is worse than no scale, because the holes are not labelled.

**H17. Edit corrects `occurred`, never `created`. Edit is the input sheet, not a second editor.**

**What is editable:** note, category, audience, media, and when the record *happened* — `occurred_on` / `occurred_time`, freely for a drop, and for a session subject to the same exclusion constraint and containment check any write faces (H10). A moved record surfaces the same calm collision message the input sheet shows.

**`ended_at`, refined.** Stop is the only **initial** writer of an end: a running session's end is written by the act of stopping, and an edit cannot invent one — `/now` and the now band are untouched by this. **Once a record has finished, its end is a past fact, and past facts are correctable**, which is the same reasoning that lets `occurred` be edited. So a finished timed Ripple shows start *and* end fields, with the duration derived beside them and never typed into: exclusion and containment both validate on times, so times are the unit of truth and a duration input would be a second way to say the same thing.

An edited end revalidates everything a new write faces — end after start, the top-level exclusion constraint, and containment of every inner ripple. That last one needed a new trigger: 0002 checks containment when a *child* moves, which cannot catch a *parent* shrinking away from under its children. Editing an end made that reachable from the UI, so the invariant moved to where it can be held.

When an inner ripple is the blocker, the message names it — "that span leaves the break at 09:20 outside this session" — because "that does not fit" leaves the author hunting, and naming the thing in the way is the difference between a refusal and an answer.

**What is not editable:** `created_at`, because **the occurred/created separation exists so that a correction edits when it happened while the diary still remembers when you wrote it.** A backfill lands on the right day without pretending you were there; an edit fixes a typo without pretending you never made it. Drops are unchanged: a drop makes no duration claim (E2), so it has no end to correct.

**One editor.** Edit opens the input sheet prefilled, with the commit reading *Update*. A second editor would be a second place that knows how to describe a Ripple, and the two would drift — the first thing to drift being which fields exist.

**Delete is hard and takes the inside with it.** A session's inner ripples cascade, and the confirm says how many rather than asking twice. Media goes with the rows, gathered before the delete because afterwards nothing says which objects were theirs. No undo, no grace period, no "moved to trash": what you remove is removed.

**Media stores paths, and visibility is checked against the Ripple.** `ripples.media` holds storage paths, never URLs — a URL is a credential with an expiry baked in, so a row holding one rots. Serving signs on demand, after checking the *Ripple's* visibility through the viewer's own session. S0 rejected a path-prefix read policy for this reason: `<owner>/…` can only answer "is this mine", and in P2 a linked friend must see media on a Ripple they may see while still being refused a locked one. The write side keeps the prefix policy, which is the right question for an upload.

**H18. Kind is end-presence, at the input surface too. The present is written by the Timer.**

A Ripple is timed because it *has a span*, not because a timer produced it. The database already said so — `ended_at` null or equal to the start is a drop, later is a span (SPEC 8) — and `rippleKind` has only ever read those two columns. The input surface was the last place still treating kind as provenance, which is why a span could be recorded only by living through it: a meeting that happened while the phone was in a bag had no way in, and a backfilled session had to be invented by starting and immediately stopping a timer.

So the time control gains an optional end. Commit stays **Drop** regardless of span, because Drop means *set this record down* and the kind derives from the end field; making the button name track the kind would restore the mode state E3 removed, and it would put the same record behind two different buttons depending on a field's value.

**The one line that cannot be crossed: a typed span may not straddle now.** It must lie wholly in the past or wholly in the future, and a straddling span is refused with the offer to start the Timer instead. Why: an in-progress record is the one thing on the surface that is *alive* — the now band, the focus screen, the travelling water, the whole of SPEC 7's law 3 — and the Timer is what makes it live. Letting an end be typed into the present would mean a record that claims to be running while nothing is running it, whose end is a prediction the author has already been billed for. A future span is honest by contrast: it renders planned, like every other future record, and says so.

Rejected: (a) a separate "log a past session" surface — a second editor, which H17 settled against; (b) a duration input beside the times — exclusion and containment both validate on times, so times are the unit of truth and a duration field would be a second way to say the same thing that has to be kept in agreement; (c) allowing a straddling span and quietly clamping the end to now — a silent rewrite of what the author typed.

**Consequence for inner ripples:** "inner composition is Drop-only" loosens into **"inner mode has no Timer"**. A typed span is allowed inside a session, validated by containment. This costs nothing that H15a2 relied on: a break was made identifiable by its *span* rather than by a name or a flag precisely so that the identification would not depend on breaks being the only producer of one — and that choice now pays, because they no longer are.
