# During Roadmap

Session-sized milestones. One session = one Claude Code working block with a demoable definition of done. Order within a phase is dependency order; do not pull later sessions forward. The tab bar grows with scope: a tab appears only when its screen ships.

Scope is cut into **phases**, solo-first (H11). The app becomes complete for one person before anyone is invited: the founding constraint is that a user is complete with zero pools, and friends' onboarding is a one-shot resource that should not be spent on a build which has not yet proven it is worth opening daily.

*Mapping from the old labels, stated once:* v1a splits across P1 and P2; v1b's Lanes matrix moves into P1 and its Spotify suggestion into P1.5; v1.5 becomes P3. The v1a/v1b/v1.5 labels are retired.

## P1: solo-complete

| # | Session | Builds | Done when | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S0 | Foundation | Repo, Tailwind tokens, full schema migration + RLS, typed clients, Google auth + profile bootstrap (timezone, category seed), shell (Home + Locker + FAB), seed fixtures | Fresh clone reaches signed-in empty Home in 10 min; RLS test proves locked ripples invisible to a linked friend | done |
| S1 | Wave system | SVG primitives in `components/ui/waves/`: wave line (drop), bundle (timed, log-scaled line count at constant gap), planned at reduced opacity, multi-ring commit ripple, travelling motion for in-progress, `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks, fixture page at `/dev/waves` | Every ripple state in the seed renders correctly, static and animated, and looks right against `_docs/mockups/` | done |
| S2 | Home Daily read | Ordered time axis (top = early), ripples placed by occurred_time, Daily Note area (several per day), date pager with author-tz boundaries, scroll anchors, duration chips, timeline exclusivity + inner ripples | Seed data renders as the mockup's Home Daily; anchors behave per SPEC 5 | done |
| S3 | Input sheet | Half-sheet with chips, single note field, segmented time toggle, audience chip, Drop / Timer dual commit, progressive landing rail, three entry points, running-session stop, collision surfaced as UX | A chip-only zero-character drop lands; the rail shows the ghost when the time is touched; a deliberate overlap is caught and named | done |
| S3.5 | Running record | Full-screen focus surface for a running timed (solid #0507C9, white travelling waves, elapsed at display size, stop behind a confirm, add-to-session entry); the now band on Home Daily replacing the plain running row | Starting a timer turns the row into the band; tapping it submerges into the focus screen; stop stills everything back into a finished bundle | done |
| S4 | Ripple mini sheet | Half-sheet on tap: note, time, media, lock state, inner ripples with their own entry point. **No view count** — that is P2, because it needs an audience to count | Tapping a ripple opens it; an inner ripple can be filed into its parent from here | done |
| S5 | Care | Hard delete including storage objects, photo attach + upload, final empty-state copy (empty day, empty Trail, empty Lanes) | Delete removes row and media; every empty state shows designed copy | done |
| S6 | Recall | Lanes matrix (my categories x days, locked included unmarked; tab appears now) with a lane's own edit sheet; Locker Trail (full personal scroll including locked ripples, date-sectioned, sinking sections per law 1) | A month of my own records is browsable by category and by day | done |
| S7 | Ship for one | Cloud Supabase promotion (slot from cleanup or second free org), Vercel deploy, OAuth redirect config, PWA-ish phone usability pass | during.today serves my own day from my phone | done |
| S8 | The Splash pivot (H20) | Home as one ordinal flow with ripple/splash modes; Splash boards (solo), the splash screen, lane inheritance, detach-on-delete; the ripple sheet and the splash sheet; ink-fill selection; six-lane preset; live-tracking surfaces dormant; exclusion constraint dropped | Note-only, photo-only and plain fragments from the FAB; a last-week annotation moves one; a laned splash from the tab bar inherits its lane; the board floats at the top of splash mode and its +Drop settles away; modes flip by toggle and by quiet mark without losing my place; the splash screen reads with photos large | done |
| S9 | The refounding (H21) | Ripples compose Splashes; Sessions (derived monthly shelves, custom shelves, the shelf view, the sessions sheet from the scrubber's `=`); Home as the blue water ground scoped by month with the lane header, the post grid, the scrubber and the pinned bar; the post's white page with in-place writing; the one post sheet; inheritance as defaults; delete cascades to blocks; the two-mode home, quiet marks, mode toggle, sheet pair and `+ with wave` retired | A titled two-paragraph post from the FAB plays the ring; a one-line untitled post; a post extended in place with a block dated last week surfaces in both months; a differently-laned block turns the lane into tags; a pinned post is reachable from the bar while scrubbed to August; September is titled from the sessions sheet; a custom session with two posts reads grouped by lane |  |

## P1.5: dogfood window

Daily personal use, small fixes, no new surfaces unless use demands them.

- First candidate: Spotify now-playing suggestion — client-side fetch when the sheet opens, one-tap prefill, no background jobs, no stored tokens.
- Quiet-day handling polish.

**What this window can conclude (H11):** input cost and recall value only — whether a record is cheap enough to make, and whether the archive is worth returning to. **Solo usage decay is not evidence of product failure.** The witnessed hook is absent by design until P2, so its absence explains a decay that says nothing about the product with friends present.

## P2: Link world

- Link + invite link (mutual), friends strip with live ring + elapsed
- The audience chip returns to the ripple sheet; Splash shared by two (H20d, H20g)
- Friend rail on the far right, sharing the time axis; Realtime updates when a friend drops
- View-count UI: opening a Ripple records a view event; the count is visible to the author only
- Presence TTL surfacing: 3d hardcoded, computed at read, expired members absent with no badge

**The witnessing experiment runs here.** 4 to 6 weeks with real friends, then SPEC section 1's hypotheses are reviewed against their decide-by signals (reaction migration, "who saw this?" asks, quoting friction, cross-day scroll requests, recording persistence). Decisions land in DECISIONS.md as group I before any P3 work begins.

## P3: Pool world (only after the P2 review)

- Pool create + invite code; join screen = mapping privacy contract (pre-checked matches, residual categories unchecked, lurker join first-class)
- Pools tab (Lobby: my pools + join with code, activity ripple badges); tab appears now
- Swimmers (Daily time-aligned score view, Weekly person-column matrix, me-first + join order)
- Pool Lanes matrix; Home Lanes column headers become mapping dashboards
- Splash pool-wide (H20d): the compound pool pill, the joint ripples filter, the sharing record carrying `pool_lane_id`; participants on ripples
- Swim: FAB entry + lane long-press, live intruding card, focus screen = enlarged lane card + my timer, nothing more. **The dormant live modules (Timer, now band, focus screen, Break, inner ripples) wake here** (H20b)

## Later, unscheduled

Home Weekly zoom; one year ago today; background auto-collection (timeline autofill; Spotify first); Lists UI and multi-pool routing settings; notifications (Splash opened / Swim started / Link request only, max 2/day); Splash-born ephemeral pools; open/searchable pools; desktop score layout + ambient window; couple weekly grouping on Splash; recurrence engine; note-convention parsing; photo book export; dark mode (night pool); TTL setting UI (instant/1d/3d/7d).

## Standing rules

- A phase's list never grows mid-session; new ideas go to "Later, unscheduled" or to DECISIONS.md.
- Any schema change after S0 is one migration with a one-line rationale in the commit.
- Hypothesis features (reactions, viewer lists, chat) are not built even if requested casually during a dogfood window; they wait for the P2 review.
