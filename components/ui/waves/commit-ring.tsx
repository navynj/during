 * against an avatar's edge reads as a border, not as water leaving it. The
 * first ring's diameter is therefore the content plus a gap, and the travel
 * is whatever remains out to `size`.
 *
 * Staggered rather than simultaneous, so they read as one disturbance moving
 * outward instead of a set of circles scaling together. Under reduced motion
 * the rings are drawn nested at rest, which is the same figure the animation
 * passes through — the design reads correctly static (law 3).
