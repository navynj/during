 * The suite as a deploy can run it: everything except the files that talk to
 * a live Postgres.
 *
 * Those are not skipped for being slow — they are the ones that prove RLS,
 * the exclusion constraint and the containment triggers actually hold, and
 * they have to keep running locally before every push. A build machine has no
 * stack to point them at, so it runs the rest rather than pretending.

/**
 * React ships two builds, and `act` exists only in the development one. A
 * deploy sets NODE_ENV=production for the whole build, vitest respects an
 * NODE_ENV that is already set, and the suite then resolves
 * `react-dom-test-utils.production.js` — where every render fails with
 * "React.act is not a function".
 *
 * Set here rather than in the script so no way of invoking the suite can miss
 * it. Tests are a development-time activity whatever the surrounding build is
 * doing; a suite run against production React is testing a different program.
