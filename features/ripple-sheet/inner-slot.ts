 * **After the last thing already inside the session**, falling back to the
 * session's own start when there is nothing inside it yet — and back to the
 * start again if that would land on or past the end, since the span is
 * half-open and its final instant is not inside it.
 *
 * Chosen over the midpoint because adding to a finished session is usually
 * remembering something *else that happened*, and things are remembered in
 * the order they happened. A midpoint is arithmetic; the end of what is
 * already there is where the next thing goes.
