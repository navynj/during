# CLAUDE.md

## What this project is

During (during.today): a one-line diary that assembles itself. While you write it, your presence shows on the surface for a few close friends. Solo-built portfolio project (design engineer case study) plus real daily use with friends. Records are written for oneself; sharing is a leak, not a broadcast.

## Source of truth

- `_docs/SPEC.md`: the product spec (v0.22). Authoritative for behavior, vocabulary, IA, visual system, schema, and scope. Read the relevant section before building any screen.
- `_docs/DECISIONS.md`: the decision log with rationale and rejected alternatives. Do not re-litigate settled decisions. If implementation genuinely forces a revisit, stop and flag it; never silently deviate.
- `_docs/mockups/`: current Figma exports. Visual reference for layout and the wave grammar. **The five Splash-pivot frames are the layout authority for Home and the sheets** (H20): `home-ripple-mode.png`, `home-splash-mode.png`, `sheet-ripple.png`, `sheet-splash.png`, `splash-thread.png`; where the brief and one of these disagree, the mockup wins. The older exports predate SPEC v0.2; where one of those and SPEC conflict, SPEC wins. Flag the conflict instead of guessing.

**If the mockup contains a drawn shape, ask for the Figma-exported SVG before generating one.** Guessing at drawn geometry is the most expensive mistake so far: a generated wave was rebuilt from the export, and the exported numbers turned out to be load-bearing (control offsets that make the amplitude land exactly inside the stroke box). Reading a shape off a PNG gets the impression right and the construction wrong.

**Text replacements in code or docs must assert. A patch that matches nothing is a failure, not a no-op.** A replacement whose target string has drifted — reformatted by Prettier, edited earlier in the session — changes no file, breaks no type, and returns success. Run edits so a failed assertion aborts the task (`set -e`, or chain with `&&`); never let one script's failure leave the next one running.

**After any doc-sync task, grep the file for the new content before claiming it.** A passing build is not evidence that a doc edit landed — documents are not compiled. `scripts/verify-doc.sh FILE "needle" ...` exits non-zero when a string is absent; run it before committing, and let a doc-sync commit message claim only what it printed.

When the spec is silent, choose the smallest implementation consistent with DECISIONS and say so in the commit message. If it smells like a product decision, ask instead of deciding.

## Current scope: P1 (solo-complete)

Scope is cut into phases, solo-first (H11). **P1 makes the app complete for one person, before anyone is invited.** Build in roughly this order:

1. Auth (social login) and profile bootstrap (category seed from preset) — done
2. Wave system, Home Daily read view — done
3. Input sheet — done, then **replaced by the Splash pivot (H20)**: a ripple sheet (chips, note, `+ Add Time`, `+ Add Image`, `+ Add to Splash`, one Drop) and a splash sheet (Add Lanes, title, `+ Add Date`, one Drop). No Timer, no audience chip, no in-sheet mode toggle: the entry path decides which sheet opens
4. Ripple mini half-sheet: tap a wave, see note, annotation, media, splash, lock toggle. **No view count in P1** — counting needs an audience — done
5. Delete (hard delete, including media); photo attach — done
6. Designed empty-state copy — done
7. Lanes read-only matrix; Locker Trail (full personal scroll including locked ripples) — done
8. Deploy: cloud Supabase + Vercel, because daily use on a phone requires it — done
9. **The Splash pivot (H20)**: Home as one ordinal flow keyed on `COALESCE(occurred, created_at)` with ripple/splash view modes; Splash as a personal topic board (solo), the splash screen, lane inheritance, detach-on-delete; six-lane preset; ink-fill selection

**Dormant, never deleted (H20b):** the Timer commit, the now band, the focus screen (`features/focus/`), Break, inner ripples (`parent_ripple_id` and its triggers stay). Their modules and tests stay in place with no entry point or navigation; P3's Swim is their consumer. Do not wire them back into a surface, and do not remove them.

**The record is a story fragment, not an activity spec (H20a).** The hand throws moments at stories; the machine shelves them in time. An unannotated fragment flows in posting order; an `occurred` annotation is an instruction to place it where it happened. The exclusion constraint is gone: overlapping spans are legitimate records.

Explicitly NOT in P1 (do not scaffold, stub, or placeholder): Link and invites, the friend rail, view counts, presence TTL surfacing, the audience chip, Splash shared by two — all P2. Pools and everything inside them (including the pool pill on a splash and pool-side lane mappings), Lists UI, Home Weekly — P3 or later. Tab slots are full by design: never add a tab. A tab appears only when its screen ships. Tabs today: Home / Lanes / Locker.

**P1.5** is a dogfood window: daily personal use and small fixes, first candidate the Spotify now-playing suggestion. **P2** adds the Link world and is where the witnessing experiment runs. **P1/P1.5 validate input cost and recall value only — solo usage decay is not evidence of product failure**, because the witnessed hook is absent by design until P2.

## Data is real now

The database holds records someone actually wrote. Everything below outranks convenience, including my own.

1. **Never run `db reset`, or any destructive command, against the linked (production) project.** Not once, not to fix a migration, not because the alternative is slower. **The local database is protected too** — it currently holds real records, and it stays protected until Yoonji says in the session that it is disposable again. `pnpm db:reset` refuses unless `DURING_DB_DISPOSABLE=yes` is set for that one command, which is her declaration and never mine to make.
2. **Migrations are forward-only.** A schema change is a new migration file, rehearsed against a local fixture database, applied to prod with `supabase db push` and nothing else. **Destructive DDL — `DROP`, narrowing a column type, removing an RLS policy — needs her explicit approval in the session, quoted in the commit message.** `pnpm db:push` scans the pending migrations and refuses when it finds any, unless that approval is passed through.
3. **Backups are ours to make: the free tier has none.** `pnpm backup` writes a schema + data dump of the linked database to `backups/<timestamp>.sql` (gitignored) and a listing of storage objects beside it. **Running it is mandatory before every push to prod**, and `pnpm db:push` refuses without a dump from today. Object _bytes_ are not in that dump — Postgres does not hold them — so a bucket restore is manual. Remind her that weekly-ish dumps are hers to run.
4. **Never decide data migration on her behalf.** Whether local records are carried into prod or prod starts empty is her call, asked once, in the session.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript strict. Deployed on Vercel.
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime. Local-first development via `supabase start`. Schema changes only through migration files; never edit an applied migration.
- Tailwind CSS. TanStack Query for server state. No global client-state library until a concrete need appears.
- Waves are inline SVG components. No canvas in v1.

## Non-negotiable engineering rules

- **RLS on every table, no exceptions.** The leak model's two visibility paths (Link path, Pool path) are enforced in RLS policies, not in application code. The client must never receive rows the viewer is not allowed to see. Locker-only (locked) ripples are visible solely to their author.
- **Timezone:** `occurred_on` and `occurred_time` are author-local. Day boundaries are computed in the author's timezone (store the author's tz on the profile). This app will be used across Vancouver and Korea from week one.
- **Submerge is never stored.** Presence expiry is computed at read time from the last activity timestamp.
- **Deletes are hard deletes** (privacy over recovery), including storage objects.
- **The deployment's origin is configuration, never source.** It reaches the app through `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and nothing else (`lib/site.ts` is the only reader), so one build serves a preview, a local run and production. A domain written into a file is a second source of truth that only disagrees once, and an origin mismatch fails _silently_ — S0's lesson. `pnpm lint` fails on it.
- One vocabulary, one table: every remaining record is a row in `ripples`.

## Design tokens and visual rules

- The ONLY custom design tokens are three color ramps plus the typeface. Everything else (spacing, radius, type scale) uses the Tailwind default scale.
  - Main ramp (content vitality): `#0507C9` live/now, `#787BE2` recent, `#D3D7F6` settled/past
  - Gray ramp (structure): `#F1F3F7` surfaces, `#D8DCE8` deeper surfaces / dividers / lane ropes, `#6B79A3` muted text
  - Ink: `#313338` body text
- Typeface: **Poppins** (weights 300/400/500/600/700), self-hosted via `next/font/google` and exposed as Tailwind's `--font-sans`, so `font-sans` and `body` cannot drift apart. The type size _scale_ is untouched.
- Tracking is tightened 5%: the whole `--tracking-*` scale shifts by `-0.05em` (so `tracking-normal` is `-0.05em`), and `body` states it because browsers default to `0`. Shifting the scale rather than only the base keeps the steps' relative distance.
- **Weight: `font-semibold` is the emphasis weight.** Reach for it wherever you would reflexively write `font-bold`; 600 carries emphasis in Poppins without the heaviness. `font-bold` (700) stays loaded for the rare case that genuinely needs it, but is not the default. The header's year + month label is `font-medium`.
- **Two fills, two meanings (H20f).** Solid `#0507C9` (`main-900`) fill = **action**: Drop, +Drop, the FAB, waves, live surfaces. Solid ink `#313338` fill = **selection**: the selected category chip, the active mode-toggle segment. White text on both. Blue fills on a screen point only at what commits or creates; a selected chip is `bg-ink text-white`, never `bg-main-900`. Outline chips (a splash's lane chips) are never filled.
- **`#787BE2` (`main-400`) is a chip foreground and a wave tone. Nothing else.** Its only text use is the foreground of small tag-like chips (the duration chip); otherwise it exists solely inside the wave vitality ramp as the "recent" tone. It is not a general accent color, and it never colors headings, labels, time markers, or chrome. An unselected category chip's text is `pool-500`, not `main-400`.
- Text colors, in full:
  - Default text: `#313338` (ink).
  - Emphasis / accent text: `#0507C9` (`main-900`).
  - Muted or secondary text, only where the hierarchy needs it: `#6B79A3` (`pool-500`).
  - `#D3D7F6` is never text.
  - Active or selected states in chrome (tab bar, pagers) use `#0507C9` (`main-900`) with weight; inactive is the same color faded by `opacity-20` on the item wrapper, never per-element alpha — one fade for the whole item, so icon and label can never drift apart. This is chrome, not content: SPEC 7 law 1 reserves the opacity channel for _time_ on Ripples, and nav state is neither.
- `pnpm lint` fails on `main-400` or `#787BE2` used outside `components/ui/chips/` and `components/ui/waves/` (see `scripts/check-tokens.sh`). If a new directory legitimately renders chips or waves, add it to that allowlist rather than working around the check.
- Category emojis keep their native colors: the single allowed off-palette element.
- **Motion: only living things move.** An in-progress timed grows its last wave line; a new drop plays one expanding ring that settles to a single ring. Nothing else animates. `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback is mandatory, and every design must read correctly when static.
- Wave grammar: timed = multi-line bundle whose line count is log-scaled on duration (cap 10) at a constant gap, so height is a consequence of density, not a measure of span; drop = single wave line; a splash = its fragment count on the log scale, right-anchored. Wave counts are impressions (calm / some / lots), never precise gauges. The axis is ordered, not time-proportional: vertical distance measures nothing.
- Past sinks **within a continuous scroll** (backgrounds step white, then `#F1F3F7`, then `#D8DCE8`): Home's month sections, the Trail, Lanes. Planned-at-reduced-opacity is retired (H20c): a future-dated fragment is a normal fragment with a future date chip. Tone and opacity never encode ownership.

## Code conventions

- **Domain vocabulary in code.** Identifiers use Ripple, drop, timed, Link, Pool, Lane, Splash, Swim, Locker, Submerge, List. Forbidden identifiers: post, entry, item, group, feed, stream, deck, follower, thread. If the word is retired in SPEC section 2, it does not appear in code either. ("Fragment" is descriptive prose for a Ripple, not an identifier.)
- Structure: `app/` for routes and layouts, `features/<name>/` (components, hooks, queries colocated per feature: `features/input-sheet/`, `features/home-daily/`, `features/links/`, `features/locker/`), `components/ui/` for shared primitives (waves, chips, sheets), `lib/` for supabase clients and utilities, `supabase/migrations/` for schema.
- Server components for shells and data fetch; client components for anything that moves or accepts input. Keep components small; extract when a file passes ~150 lines.
- TypeScript: strict, no `any`, explicit return types on exported functions. Validate at boundaries (forms, route handlers) with zod. Database types generated via `supabase gen types`.
- Files kebab-case, components PascalCase, hooks `useX`.
- Comments explain why, not what. When implementing a spec rule, reference it: `// SPEC 7, law 3: only living things move`.
- Conventional commits, small and frequent. One migration per schema change.

## Definition of done for P1

I can run my own day through it, on my own phone, without help. Throw a note-only, a photo-only and a plain fragment from the FAB; annotate one with last week's date and watch it move there; create a laned splash from the tab bar's left button and watch a fragment thrown into it inherit the lane with no category choice; see the board float at the top of splash mode with its declared dates, chips and waves, and its +Drop disappear once it settles; flip modes by toggle and by tapping quiet marks without losing my place; read the splash screen with photos large. Tap a ripple to read it back, attach a photo, delete one and have the media go with it. Browse a month by category in Lanes and by day in the Trail. Every empty state shows designed copy instead of a blank.

No friend appears anywhere in that list. That is the point: P1 is finished when the app is worth opening daily with nobody watching (H15).
