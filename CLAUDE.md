## What this project is

During (during.today): a compact blog-form diary on the water. A post (a Splash) is a title and some blocks (Ripples), extended over days and shelved by month and by topic; a one-line post is a complete post (H21). While you write it, your presence shows on the surface for a few close friends. Solo-built portfolio project (design engineer case study) plus real daily use with friends. Records are written for oneself; sharing is a leak, not a broadcast.

## Source of truth

- `_docs/SPEC.md`: the product spec (v0.23). Authoritative for behavior, vocabulary, IA, visual system, schema, and scope. Read the relevant section before building any screen.
- `_docs/DECISIONS.md`: the decision log with rationale and rejected alternatives. Do not re-litigate settled decisions. If implementation genuinely forces a revisit, stop and flag it; never silently deviate.
- `_docs/mockups/`: current Figma exports. Visual reference for layout and the wave grammar. **`home-ground.png` is the layout authority for Home** (H21); the post's page, the post sheet and the sessions sheet have no mockup and follow SPEC's written geometry in the ground's visual language. The Splash-pivot frames (`home-ripple-mode.png`, `home-splash-mode.png`, `sheet-ripple.png`, `sheet-splash.png`, `splash-thread.png`) are superseded by H21 and kept as history. The older exports predate SPEC v0.2; where one of those and SPEC conflict, SPEC wins. Flag the conflict instead of guessing.

**If the mockup contains a drawn shape, ask for the Figma-exported SVG before generating one.** Guessing at drawn geometry is the most expensive mistake so far: a generated wave was rebuilt from the export, and the exported numbers turned out to be load-bearing (control offsets that make the amplitude land exactly inside the stroke box). Reading a shape off a PNG gets the impression right and the construction wrong.

**Text replacements in code or docs must assert. A patch that matches nothing is a failure, not a no-op.** A replacement whose target string has drifted — reformatted by Prettier, edited earlier in the session — changes no file, breaks no type, and returns success. Run edits so a failed assertion aborts the task (`set -e`, or chain with `&&`); never let one script's failure leave the next one running.

**After any doc-sync task, grep the file for the new content before claiming it.** A passing build is not evidence that a doc edit landed — documents are not compiled. `scripts/verify-doc.sh FILE "needle" ...` exits non-zero when a string is absent; run it before committing, and let a doc-sync commit message claim only what it printed.

When the spec is silent, choose the smallest implementation consistent with DECISIONS and say so in the commit message. If it smells like a product decision, ask instead of deciding.

## Current scope: P1 (solo-complete)

Scope is cut into phases, solo-first (H11). **P1 makes the app complete for one person, before anyone is invited.** Build in roughly this order:

1. Auth (social login) and profile bootstrap (category seed from preset) — done
2. Wave system, Home Daily read view — done
3. Input sheet — done, then **replaced by the Splash pivot (H20)**: a ripple sheet (chips, note, `+ Add Time`, `+ Add Image`, `+ Add to Splash`, one Drop) and a splash sheet (Add Lanes, title, `+ Add Date`, one Drop). No Timer, no audience chip, no in-sheet mode toggle: the entry path decides which sheet opens
4. Ripple mini half-sheet: tap a wave, see note, annotation, media, splash, lock toggle. **No view count in P1** — counting needs an audience — done
5. Delete (hard delete, including media); photo attach — done
6. Designed empty-state copy — done
7. Lanes read-only matrix; Locker Trail (full personal scroll including locked ripples) — done
8. Deploy: cloud Supabase + Vercel, because daily use on a phone requires it — done
9. The Splash pivot (H20): Splash promoted, six-lane preset, ink-fill selection — done, then **refounded by H21**
10. **The refounding (H21)**: Ripples compose Splashes (a block inside a post); Sessions as shelves (monthly derived, custom made) managed from a sheet the scrubber's `=` opens; Home as the solid-blue water ground scoped to one month (lane header, post grid oldest-at-top, month scrubber, pinned bar); the post's white page with in-place writing; one post sheet from the FAB; a declaration (date, lane) is a default, never an override; delete cascades to blocks

**Dormant, never deleted (H20b):** the Timer commit, the now band, the focus screen (`features/focus/`), Break, inner ripples (`parent_ripple_id` and its triggers stay). Their modules and tests stay in place with no entry point or navigation; P3's Swim is their consumer. Do not wire them back into a surface, and do not remove them.

**The record is a story fragment, not an activity spec (H20a).** The hand throws moments at stories; the machine shelves them in time. An unannotated block rests at its post's declared date, else where it was written; an `occurred` annotation is an instruction to place it where it happened and always wins (H21f). The exclusion constraint is gone: overlapping spans are legitimate records.

**Compactness and the lane/session structure are the core to defend (H21b).** A feature that makes a post heavier to start, or adds a second axis beside lanes and sessions, is rejected before its merits are heard.

Explicitly NOT in P1 (do not scaffold, stub, or placeholder): Link and invites, Friends, the friend rail, view counts, presence TTL surfacing, the audience chip, Splash shared by two — all P2. Pools and everything inside them (including the pool pill on a splash and pool-side lane mappings), Lists UI, Home Weekly — P3 or later. Tab slots are full by design: never add a tab. A tab appears only when its screen ships. Tabs today: Home / Locker. The Lanes tab retired at the refounding review (Home's lane header is the lanes view; the matrix is dormant for P3's pool Lanes), and session management is a sheet on Home, not a tab. Pools and Friends are reserved seats: no tab, no dead button.

**P1.5** is a dogfood window: daily personal use and small fixes, first candidate the Spotify now-playing suggestion. **P2** adds the Link world and is where the witnessing experiment runs. **P1/P1.5 validate input cost and recall value only — solo usage decay is not evidence of product failure**, because the witnessed hook is absent by design until P2.

## Data is real now

The database holds records someone actually wrote. Everything below outranks convenience, including my own.

1. **Never run `db reset`, or any destructive command, against the linked (production) project.** Not once, not to fix a migration, not because the alternative is slower. **The local database is protected too** — it currently holds real records, and it stays protected until Yoonji says in the session that it is disposable again. `pnpm db:reset` refuses unless `DURING_DB_DISPOSABLE=yes` is set for that one command, which is her declaration and never mine to make.
2. **Migrations are forward-only.** A schema change is a new migration file, rehearsed against a local fixture database, applied to prod with `supabase db push` and nothing else. **Destructive DDL — `DROP`, narrowing a column type, removing an RLS policy — needs her explicit approval in the session, quoted in the commit message.** `pnpm db:push` scans the pending migrations and refuses when it finds any, unless that approval is passed through.
3. **Backups are ours to make: the free tier has none.** `pnpm backup` writes a schema + data dump of the linked database to `backups/<timestamp>.sql` (gitignored) and a listing of storage objects beside it. **Running it is mandatory before every push to prod**, and `pnpm db:push` refuses without a dump from today. Object _bytes_ are not in that dump — Postgres does not hold them — so a bucket restore is manual. Remind her that weekly-ish dumps are hers to run.
4. **Never decide data migration on her behalf.** Whether local records are carried into prod or prod starts empty is her call, asked once, in the session.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript strict. Deployed on Vercel.
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime. Local-first development via `supabase start`. Schema changes only through migration files; never edit an applied migration.
- Tailwind CSS. TanStack Query for server state. No global client-state library until a concrete need appears.
- Waves are inline SVG components. No canvas in v1.

## Non-negotiable engineering rules

- **RLS on every table, no exceptions.** The leak model's two visibility paths (Link path, Pool path) are enforced in RLS policies, not in application code. The client must never receive rows the viewer is not allowed to see. Locker-only (locked) ripples are visible solely to their author.
- **Timezone:** `occurred_on` and `occurred_time` are author-local. Day boundaries are computed in the author's timezone (store the author's tz on the profile). This app will be used across Vancouver and Korea from week one.
- **Submerge is never stored.** Presence expiry is computed at read time from the last activity timestamp.
- **Deletes are hard deletes** (privacy over recovery), including storage objects.
- **The deployment's origin is configuration, never source.** It reaches the app through `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and nothing else (`lib/site.ts` is the only reader), so one build serves a preview, a local run and production. A domain written into a file is a second source of truth that only disagrees once, and an origin mismatch fails _silently_ — S0's lesson. `pnpm lint` fails on it.
- One vocabulary, one table: every remaining record is a row in `ripples`.

## Design tokens and visual rules

- The ONLY custom design tokens are three color ramps plus the typeface. Everything else (spacing, radius, type scale) uses the Tailwind default scale.
  - Main ramp (content vitality): `#0507C9` live/now, `#787BE2` recent, `#D3D7F6` settled/past
  - Gray ramp (structure): `#F1F3F7` surfaces, `#D8DCE8` deeper surfaces / dividers / lane ropes, `#6B79A3` muted text
  - Ink: `#161621` body text (was `#313338` until the refounding review)
- Typeface: **Poppins** (weights 300/400/500/600/700), self-hosted via `next/font/google` and exposed as Tailwind's `--font-sans`, so `font-sans` and `body` cannot drift apart. The type size _scale_ is untouched.
- Tracking is tightened 5%: the whole `--tracking-*` scale shifts by `-0.05em` (so `tracking-normal` is `-0.05em`), and `body` states it because browsers default to `0`. Shifting the scale rather than only the base keeps the steps' relative distance.
- **Weight: `font-semibold` is the emphasis weight.** Reach for it wherever you would reflexively write `font-bold`; 600 carries emphasis in Poppins without the heaviness. `font-bold` (700) stays loaded for the rare case that genuinely needs it, but is not the default. The header's year + month label is `font-medium`.
- **Two fills, two meanings (H20f).** Solid `#0507C9` (`main-900`) fill = **action**: Drop, +Drop, the FAB, waves. Solid ink `#161621` fill = **selection**: the selected category chip, the selected lane header, the pinned bar. The sessions sheet's current month reads in `#0507C9` text, no fill. White text on both. Blue fills on a white screen point only at what commits or creates; a selected chip is `bg-ink text-white`, never `bg-main-900`. Outline chips (a post's lane tags) are never filled.
- **The ground inverts (H21c).** Home's ground is solid `#0507C9` (`.water-ground`): the water, not a live session. On it, white carries content and action (post pills, waves as data, the empty-state line) and ink stays selection. A post's wave mark is white waves on a blue disc, per the mockup; a lone block standing in as a post is the inverse pill — blue with a white outer border, its mark a white disc. The scrubber's months differ by opacity only, never size, each under its year in white. The post's page is a white page above the water.
- **`#787BE2` (`main-400`) is a chip foreground and a wave tone. Nothing else.** Its only text use is the foreground of small tag-like chips (the duration chip); otherwise it exists solely inside the wave vitality ramp as the "recent" tone. It is not a general accent color, and it never colors headings, labels, time markers, or chrome. An unselected category chip's text is `pool-500`, not `main-400`.
- Text colors, in full:
  - Default text: `#161621` (ink).
  - Emphasis / accent text: `#0507C9` (`main-900`).
  - Muted or secondary text, only where the hierarchy needs it: `#6B79A3` (`pool-500`).
  - `#D3D7F6` is never text.
  - Active or selected states in chrome (tab bar, pagers) use `#0507C9` (`main-900`) with weight; inactive is the same color faded by `opacity-20` on the item wrapper, never per-element alpha — one fade for the whole item, so icon and label can never drift apart. This is chrome, not content: SPEC 7 law 1 reserves the opacity channel for _time_ on Ripples, and nav state is neither.
- `pnpm lint` fails on `main-400` or `#787BE2` used outside `components/ui/chips/` and `components/ui/waves/` (see `scripts/check-tokens.sh`). If a new directory legitimately renders chips or waves, add it to that allowlist rather than working around the check.
- Category emojis keep their native colors: the single allowed off-palette element.
- **Motion: only living things move.** An in-progress timed grows its last wave line; a new drop plays one expanding ring that settles to a single ring. One stated exception: the ghost ring at the head of a list ripples continuously, the invitation being the seat of the next living thing (SPEC 7 law 3). Nothing else animates. `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback is mandatory, and every design must read correctly when static.
- Wave grammar: timed = multi-line bundle whose line count is log-scaled on duration (cap 10) at a constant gap, so height is a consequence of density, not a measure of span; drop = single wave line; a splash = its fragment count on the log scale, right-anchored. Wave counts are impressions (calm / some / lots), never precise gauges. The axis is ordered, not time-proportional: vertical distance measures nothing.
- On the ground, time reads downward within a month (top = month start, bottom = now) and the past recedes along the month scrubber, fading with distance (H21d). On the white continuous scrolls the past sinks (backgrounds step white, then `#F1F3F7`, then `#D8DCE8`): the Trail, Lanes. Planned-at-reduced-opacity is retired (H20c): a future-dated block is a normal block with a future date chip. Tone and opacity never encode ownership.

## Code conventions

- **Domain vocabulary in code.** Identifiers use Ripple, drop, timed, Link, Pool, Lane, Splash, Session, Swim, Locker, Submerge, List. Forbidden identifiers: post, entry, item, group, feed, stream, deck, follower, thread. If the word is retired in SPEC section 2, it does not appear in code either. ("Fragment", "block" and "post" are descriptive prose for a Ripple and a Splash, never identifiers. "Session" in code means a shelf (H21); the dormant live modules keep their old `session` identifiers until P3 renames them.)
- Structure: `app/` for routes and layouts, `features/<name>/` (components, hooks, queries colocated per feature: `features/home/`, `features/splash/`, `features/splash-sheet/`, `features/sessions/`, `features/locker/`, `features/lanes/`), `components/ui/` for shared primitives (waves, chips, pills), `lib/` for supabase clients and utilities, `supabase/migrations/` for schema.
- Server components for shells and data fetch; client components for anything that moves or accepts input. Keep components small; extract when a file passes ~150 lines.
- TypeScript: strict, no `any`, explicit return types on exported functions. Validate at boundaries (forms, route handlers) with zod. Database types generated via `supabase gen types`.
- Files kebab-case, components PascalCase, hooks `useX`.
- Comments explain why, not what. When implementing a spec rule, reference it: `// SPEC 7, law 3: only living things move`.
- Conventional commits, small and frequent. One migration per schema change.

## Definition of done for P1

I can run my own day through it, on my own phone, without help. Drop a post from the FAB with a title line and two paragraphs and watch the ring at its pill; drop a one-line untitled post; open a post and extend it in place with a block dated last week, and see the post surface in both months; declare a lane on a post and watch a differently-laned block turn the lane into tags; pin a post and reach it from the pinned bar while scrubbed to August; title September from the sessions sheet; create a custom session, assign two posts, and read its shelf grouped by lane. Attach a photo, delete a post and have its blocks and media go with it. Filter a month by lane on the ground and browse by day in the Trail. Every empty state shows designed copy instead of a blank.

No friend appears anywhere in that list. That is the point: P1 is finished when the app is worth opening daily with nobody watching (H15).
