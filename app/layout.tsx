/**
 * `viewportFit: 'cover'` is load-bearing, not polish: the tab bar, the bottom
 * sheets and the Lanes strip all pad themselves with `env(safe-area-inset-*)`,
 * and those resolve to 0 under the default viewport. Without this the bar sits
 * under the home indicator on a notched phone and every sheet's last control
 * is half unreachable.
 *
 * Zoom is left alone. Pinching out of a small time label is the kind of thing
 * a diary has to allow.
 *
 * The status bar is white, not #0507C9. Law 5 gives a solid #0507C9 *content*
 * surface one meaning — a live session — and the status bar is always there,
 * so tinting it would claim the app is running something whenever it is open.
 * It is also the app's own ground, which is what makes the bar disappear into
 * the page instead of sitting on top of it as a band.
